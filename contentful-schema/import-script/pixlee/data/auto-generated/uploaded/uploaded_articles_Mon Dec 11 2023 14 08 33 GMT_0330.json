    "content": "<p id=\"\">Fighting for your audience’s attention share on social media is harder than ever before. You aren’t just competing against other brands’ sponsored posts – you’re competing against viral content creators. To stay competitive, many brands partner with content creators and influencers to seamlessly engage their audiences and even grow their reach.However, success with this method only comes with knowledge of what works and what doesn’t. While the influencer marketing industry is expected to reach a <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/influencer-marketing-trends\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">market cap of 5.8 billion</a> by the end of 2021, 33% of brand teams still don’t measure the ROI of their influencer efforts. This makes it difficult to track campaign impact and sales reach and is one of the common influencer marketing mistakes your brand should avoid.</p><h2 id=\"\">Top 10 Influencer Marketing Mistakes To Avoid</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Using the Wrong <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer Management Tool</a> (or Not Using One at All)</h3><p id=\"\">An influencer management tool like Pixlee’s serves to help you build a strong relationship with your selected influencer, as well as discover potential influencers in your industry to partner with. It helps you keep track of communication, influencer progress and store essential information that will make the promotion go smoothly. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1196px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1196px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2abbbf819cc0d6a77111_image2-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Pixlee’s platform lets brands search by different filters like location to discover their ideal influencer to begin a partnership with.</p><p id=\"\">There are specific tools and platforms you should look for in your Influencer CRM Platform depending on your niche and industry. That’s why Pixlee offers versions ideal for ecommerce and small businesses, and options for enterprises looking to hire hundreds of influencers. Another mistake you could make is not using these platforms at all. Depending on how many influencers you’ll work with, you risk getting overwhelmed with data and messages and overlooking important aspects of your promotion. </p><h3 id=\"\">2. Ruling out <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Micro-Influencers</a></h3><p id=\"\">When selecting the right influencer, you might think that the bigger their audience, the better the results. However, that’s not always the case. There are several levels of influencers, and each brings different benefits:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Nano influencers</a> (often found among your existing customers)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Micro-Influencers </li> \t<li id=\"\">Macro influencers </li> \t<li id=\"\">Celebrities</li></ul><p id=\"\">While showing your product to a huge audience of mega influencers might sound ideal, you shouldn’t rule out micro influencers. They have about 1,000 to 50,000 followers, and they are people with a specific set of interests. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1478px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1478px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2abbad3886363fb32f59_image3-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Tentsile uses affiliate marketing with its micro-influencers, giving these users a unique discount code to track campaign success and ROI.Micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates because they have a carefully-curated audience of individuals with niche interests. Check out more <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencers-in-2021-8-things-brands-should-know/\" target=\"_blank\">benefits of micro-influencers</a> if you’re not convinced.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Not Being Transparent </h3><p id=\"\">There are too many influencers out there who don’t have a habit of disclosing their relationship with brands, and you should know that followers don’t like it. Not disclosing sponsorships is close to lying, and followers have every right to react negatively to those ads. It may sound counterproductive to demand that an influencer disclose their relationship with you. However, people want to know what brands these influencers are willing to work with, and this doesn’t have to compromise authenticity. Give the influencer creative freedom with their content, and they can still convey their genuine support for your brand while being honest about the partnership.</p><p id=\"\">After all, the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Federal Trade Commission</a> requires that influencers disclose all affiliate relationships and brand sponsorships to remain compliant with the law. This measure is mostly aimed at preventing deceptive ads, and you should support your influencer in doing it. </p><h3 id=\"\">4. Disregarding Your Existing Fans as Brand Advocates</h3><p id=\"\">When you start a business, you’ll likely have customers that shop at your place regularly and post about your products on social media. Since word-of-mouth is the most powerful marketing channel, these people are ideal candidates to promote your brand on their personal accounts through <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC). </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1342px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1342px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2acc70ba9a6c4f7cf897_kimpton-instagram-ugc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Kimpton regularly shares high-quality UGC collected with Pixlee to its social channels and in <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/kimpton-hotels\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">over 60 hotel destination site pages</a> to show its followers how real people are interacting with the brand</p><p id=\"\">Reach out to your followers and the people that showed support when you started. Your existing fans can be some of the best influencers. Consistently encourage them to share their experiences with your brand (whether on social media or direct upload to your site), and you’ll have a bank of authentic UGC to share on your brand’s own channels. UGC shows potential customers that you have built a trusting brand community and care about your loyal customers.</p><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pixlee’s platform</a> allows brands to track mentions, hashtags, tagged images, and more on your social channels of choice, and automatically pulls in UGC from fans to be curated and published by your team. This offers a cost-efficient and authentic solution to content marketing and management.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Limiting Your Influencer Campaign to Social Media</h3><p id=\"\">Depending on your brand’s niche, you’ll likely need an influencer who’s active on at least two major social media platforms. They’ll probably also have different numbers of followers on every account, which brings additional benefits in terms of tight-knit communities or wide exposure. However, social media networks are not the only place where influencers can promote your product. Depending on your industry, you might also consider paying your selected influencers to join you for email marketing campaigns, in-person events, podcasts, and other marketing endeavors.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2acc889fbd54db1391bb_jane-k-email.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Jewelry brand Jane Koenig features one of its influencers in a community marketing email, showcasing her favorite products along with a bio and link to her social handles.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Not Creating Different Types of Content</h3><p id=\"\">Every social network allows for creating different kinds of content, whether it’s text, video, or image. So, you should always work with the influencer on creating various types of content. Textual posts will help your selected influencer create some of the best-written posts and showcase their opinion of the product. They can also post short reviews or an excerpt of a more comprehensive review they wrote on their blog and link to your business. &nbsp;Images and videos should always represent the product as it is. That being said, influencers can still express their creativity with these posts. With different content options out there like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/unboxing-videos-an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-sourcing-creating-and-monetizing-unboxing-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">unboxing videos</a> and tutorials, influencers can showcase the product from all angles and pique the interest of your audience. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1828px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1828px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2acc67fa07e34e5aa3aa_morphe-influencer-video-tutorial.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Morphe reshares a makeup video tutorial on Instagram from one of its influencers to diversify content, giving all the product details in the caption.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Missing a Call-To-Action (CTA)</h3><p id=\"\">The idea of hiring an influencer means they’ll be helping your company achieve a specific goal (or a few specific goals). This is why it can be important to include a CTA. &nbsp;This CTA should point your target audience to where they should go and push them towards what you want them to do (buy a product, subscribe to a service, etc.).</p><p id=\"\">Depending on the channel, that CTA might be more top-of-the-funnel-oriented Influencers can also use exclamation points at the end of CTA, as it can sometimes add urgency and make the Call to Action pop. Make sure to let them maintain their authentic voice, though, so nothing sounds forced.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Being Spammy with Posts</h3><p id=\"\">Everyone knows that social networks and followers love activity. But posting too much might be detrimental, especially if the selected influencer is only posting to promote a product. The following examples can help you decide how much is too much when it comes to <a href=\"https://impulsecreative.com/blog/social-media-posting-how-much-is-too-much\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media posts</a>: </p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Twitter - three to 14 times a day, no more than once per hour</li> \t<li id=\"\">Facebook - two times per day, in the morning and evening </li> \t<li id=\"\">Instagram - one to three times per day</li> \t<li id=\"\">TikTok - once a day when you start; three to five times per week later on</li></ul><p id=\"\">Set a schedule for posting, and keep in mind that the influencer should also work with different time zones so that all their followers can see your brand and the product ad. &nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">9. Not Measuring the Entire Impact of the Campaign </h3><p id=\"\">Once you decide on the influencers and start the campaign, it’s time to move forward. Influencers will work on a schedule, knowing exactly what you need them to do, but there’s more to be done on your end.</p><p id=\"\">Still, for your campaign to be successful, you should also use your CRM platform to measure everything, from revenue and sales to impressions and engagement. Keep in mind that influencer engagement is the primary measure of a campaign’s success. Pixlee’s services allow brands to reshare creator content and monitor campaign success from each influencer in-platform.</p><p id=\"\">Their engagement will tell you whether that influencer is also the right fit for future campaigns. Engagement also indicates how many people are receptive to your message. The higher the engagement, the better the chances of converting your audience into paying customers. </p><h3 id=\"\">10. Not Maintaining a Post-Campaign Relationship</h3><p id=\"\">You might think that once you finish your campaign, you’ll be done with the influencer. But that’s not the best move to make. As a brand, you <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-savvy-tips-to-find-the-perfect-influencer-for-your-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">should work on the relationship with influencers</a>. Try to stay in touch, especially if the promotion was successful. If you believe that you and the influencer are a good match, even if not necessarily one made in heaven, you should do your best to keep them. After all, if you see good results, you’ll want to maintain a mutually beneficial long-term relationship. This is another place an Influencer Marketing CRM Platform can be useful — you can revisit past campaigns and manage relationships with influencers who have already worked well with your brand.</p><p id=\"\">If, however, you didn’t see results, there’s nothing else you can do but reach out to another influencer who you believe might be a better fit. Remember, you want to maintain your relationship with the best influencers in your niche. If you’re looking for the perfect influencer, know that finding one can be challenging without the right guidance. By having the right tools, processes and briefs in place, you can avoid the most common influencer marketing mistakes.</p><p id=\"\">‍<em id=\"\">Andriana Moskovska is a Content Coordinator at Reviewlution.ca With a passion for finding the best services, products, we evaluate and review only the best solutions, even when it comes to </em><a href=\"https://reviewlution.ca/resources/content-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Content Marketing</em></a><em id=\"\">.

This AI program is a great example of how modern technology can bring a brand close to consumers. By handing out shoes to NYC Fashion Week guests, Under Armour showed customers that they care about the consumer's feedback and response to their apparel.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">From YouTube to Yelp, user-generated content (UGC) powers some of the most popular websites in the world.</p><p id=\"\">For consumers, it adds trust and transparency to the buying process. For brands, it’s a <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-marketing-power-of-user-generated-content/\" id=\"\">powerful marketing technique</a> that can double conversion rates and increase average order value.</p><p id=\"\">To maximize your team's success with UGC, consider these common challenges before getting started.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. You don’t have many customers</h2><p id=\"\">Getting content from 50 customers may be more difficult than getting it from 50,000, but it’s not impossible. As long as you have an ample batch of <em id=\"\">active</em> customers, there’s no reason your team can’t harness the power of human nature to get them talking.</p><p id=\"\">Start with simple financial incentives. When someone knows they’ll save money on their next order in exchange for a review, they’re more likely to leave one.</p><p id=\"\">People are also more likely to make their best effort when competition is at stake. Play to their <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/larry-alton-guest-post-human-need-for-approval/\" id=\"\">desire for acceptance and approval</a> by engaging customers in social contests. Customer photos put products in context for shoppers on the fence, so feature the best on product pages, galleries, and anywhere else prospective customers might lurk.</p><p id=\"\">Whatever tactic you choose, make sure it’s easy to participate. Repeat customers tend to spend more, so don’t let lengthy purchase paths hurt conversions.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Quality content needs oversight</h2><p id=\"\">User content isn’t created equally. Spam can infest social contests, bad reviews can pop up on product pages, and low-quality submissions can create the wrong impression of your brand. Even <em id=\"\">great </em>content is less effective when it’s disorganized.</p><p id=\"\">To keep UGC in top form, your team must <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/product#curate\" id=\"\">curate the most compelling images</a>, brand mentions, and product reviews across channels. It’s okay to go with your gut to start––but don’t rely on it.</p><p id=\"\">Extracting the most value from UGC means putting these hunches to the test. Is a product earning considerable shares while others lag behind? Look for trends in user content.</p><p id=\"\">You’ll stand a better chance at raising the profiles of less popular products if your team can identify which <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-social-media-marketing-influences-purchase-decisions\" id=\"\">photos and quotes resonate the most</a> with users.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Great content requires permission</h2><p id=\"\">Sourcing the best UGC is crucial to driving shares and sales. But before your team can feature any customer content in brand marketing, you’ll need to get their permission.</p><p id=\"\">Your approach should depend on your needs. Smaller teams with manageable volumes can get away with the “reply with #yes” method, a tactic where brands explicitly ask customers to confirm whether they can use their content via hashtag.</p><p id=\"\">More established brands may find this technique unsustainable. If your team receives too many photos to keep up with, consider automating the consent process. With the right UGC tools, growing brands can seek permission at scale.</p><p id=\"\">There is one noteworthy exception. When someone participates in a hashtag contest, their permission is implied––but if you hope to build trust, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-savvy-marketers-manage-customer-photo-rights-on-instagram/\" id=\"\">ask for it anyway</a>.

His photos inspire them to visit new destinations. Snapchat is already the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/11/snapchat-is-now-the-3-social-app-among-millennials/\">#3 social app among millennials</a>, and Drew predicts that “in the next three years, [it] will become the single most important marketing tool for the travel industry.”<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>2. Create More Authentic Marketing</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Studies show that <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html\">92% of customers trust online content created by peers above all other forms of advertising</a>, and this is especially true in the travel industry. Millennials now look to their favorite bloggers, vloggers, Instagrammers, and YouTubers for their next travel inspiration, rather than traditional advertising.</p><p>Factor in that a brand recommendation from an influencer carries more weight than a <a href=\"https://mediakix.com/2014/09/youtube-influencers-vs-celebrities-whos-popular-teens/\">celebrity endorsement</a>, and you will see why so many travel businesses are partnering with influencers to boast their destinations’ allure and strengthen their value proposition.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1081px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1081px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bb79f2ddb006f13e2795_Travel-Brands-Social-Media-Influencers.jpeg\" alt=\"Travel-Brands-Social-Media-Influencers.jpg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong>3. Save on Content Creation Costs</strong>‍</p><p>The good news is social media influencers want to work with your brand just as much as you want their endorsement. Influencers are constantly seeking to grow their audience through positive publicity- and partnering with reputable companies is the smartest way to achieve this.</p><p>A popular tactic is for brands to collaborate with an influencer to do a <a href=\"https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/news/the-social-media-takeover-using-influencer-marketing-to-your-advantage/\">social media takeover</a>. For example, Drew has done “Snapchat takeovers” for Yahoo and TripIt, where he posts his own travel content on the company’s Snapchat story for one day. The outcome is mutually beneficial: an influencer’s trusted content validates a company’s brand, while generating publicity and recognition for the influencer.</p><p>So how can you incentivize influencers to partner with your travel brand? Give them rewards other than cash and they’ll be more than happy to work with you. Spokesperson roles, brand ambassadorships and other PR opportunities legitimize an influencer’s reputation while growing their audience. Add to that to the costs you’ll save on ad spend, and you’ve scored a real win-win!</p><p>‍<strong>What’s Your Next Step?</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>User-generated content is a powerful marketing tool in the travel industry. The question is no longer whether businesses need to use social content, but how to maximize the impact of this content.</p><p>Social media influencers have a large hold on where millennials travel. If your brand has the resources, partner with notable travel influencers to validate and strengthen your brand. If resources are limited, tap into the valuable social proof from everyday influencers.</p><p>Still stuck on how to leverage influencer marketing for your brand? Our marketing strategists at Pixlee are here to help guide your UGC campaign. Request a Demo below and we will get you started.</p>",

Knowing this, it is only natural that you should be looking for effective ways to show off consumer reviews on your website. But should you stick to \"old-school\" practices to display customer feedback? Or should you be looking for ways to make the social proof on your site more exciting, eye-catching, and convincing?While displaying reviews in the typical format on your product pages is tried and true, you’re far more likely to stand out from competitors by employing unique methods of showcasing your customer sentiment. Let’s dive in.</p><h2>1. Embed <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\">User-Generated Content</a> Widgets</h2><p>User-generated content (UGC) makes for one of the best ways to display value, generate trust, and <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/3-ways-to-execute-an-effective-community-generated-content-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">develop a relationship with your community</a>. Deciding to embed visual UGC on your website, whether on review, community, or product pages, promises excellent returns. In fact, there are more than a few <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/8-places-user-generated-content-thrives-beyond-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">places UGC thrives</a> for brand marketing beyond resharing users posts on social media.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2560px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2560px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea058c62f0a45751cfa1e_navy-hair-care-.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Combine the power of text reviews and customer media like Navy Hair Care does with its on-site UGC galleries, which drove a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/navy-hair-care\" target=\"_blank\">264% increase in repeat-visit rate</a> for the brand’s site.</p><p>Moreover, embedded UGC is also a great way to show off your products visually in a real-life setting. It can help strengthen the visual identity of your brand through a continual commitment to your chosen brand aesthetic while instilling purchase confidence in your site visitors. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">Pixlee’s UGC capabilities</a> allow brands to create unique landing pages, site page carousels, and inspiration galleries to share the experiences of their passionate customers through their own authentic content. </p><h2>2. Use <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/moderation/\" target=\"_blank\">Moderation</a> to Showcase Relevant Reviews</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/5-things-to-look-for-when-assessing-your-ratings-reviews-providers-moderation-capabilities/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced moderation services</a> like TurnTo’s are game-changing when it comes to managing a large volume of customer reviews. Auto-moderation of reviews keeps your review content consistent and fresh across your website, allowing you to manage and organize reviews to optimize for relevance.</p><p>Moderation services provide various support tools like content tagging to speed up review publication and deliver a unique customer experience. The right automated moderation approach allows you to reduce the time and effort spent manually by your team, but still leaves space for necessary human oversight. TurnTo offers four levels of moderation support, so you can expand your ratings and review moderation strategy as your business grows. For DTC brands, combining reviews from everyday customers that your site visitors can relate to with influencer-led reviews is a surefire way to cover your bases when it comes to diversity in reviews. This approach showcases that both “normal” people and trusted community leaders value your brand.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2390px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2390px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea05780be56b98fa498da_jaclyn-reviews.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Jaclyn Cosmetics uses TurnTo’s <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/visual-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Reviews</a> along with <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/checkout-comments\" target=\"_blank\">Checkout Comments</a> to share feedback from influencers in the beauty space in addition to everyday customers. The brand also takes advantage of TurnTo’s moderation services to review, route, and curate an influx of customer feedback and make sure reviews are displayed efficiently.</p><p>Regarding review moderation, it’s important not to hide <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/heres-how-to-handle-negative-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">negative reviews</a> — consumers are likely to be suspicious of a product with only glowing comments. TurnTo flags negative reviews for your team to reply to quickly, so you can use them as an opportunity to showcase your brand’s dedication to top-notch customer service.</p><h2>3. Go Hyper-Personal With Customer Stories</h2><p>Humans are wired to love hearing and respond to other people's experiences. It makes them feel connected. And, scientific research has shown that storytelling helps speakers and listeners achieve a<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922522/\" target=\"_blank\"> temporary coupling in response patterns</a>. So, if hearing or reading a retelling of an event can make a person feel<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2018409118\" target=\"_blank\"> happy, connected, and less stressed</a>, why not employ this knowledge when choosing ways to showcase reviews on your website? Encourage your customers to share their personal stories with your brand by proudly boasting both visual and text reviews on different pages of your website. Your product page is a crucial place for this type of storytelling that taps into shoppers’ emotions.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1780px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1780px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea0574a69456052ec5fa5_Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-1.36.14-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Helzberg Diamonds uses Pixlee TurnTo to combine UGC and heartfelt reviews on its product pages, showcasing a gallery of customer images specific to each product for maximum personalization. The more you highlight customer stories in an authentic way, the more inclined your fans will be to continue sharing their experiences.</p><h2>4. Feature a Robust <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/community-qa\" target=\"_blank\">Community Q&amp;A</a> Section</h2><p>If you're looking for ways to display social proof that truly brings value to your potential customers, it's not a bad idea to include a Community Q&amp;A section where potential buyers can ask questions and receive answers from fellow customers. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea05780be56c3a4a498d9_image1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Lamps Plus maintains a strong Community Q&amp;A section on its products, combining staff and customer answers to provide customer experience and value in each response.</p><p>TurnTo’s approach to Community Q&amp;A is multifaceted; shoppers can get the answers they need while filtering through customer answers and being exposed to authentic customer sentiment. It’s not just a FAQ section, but also another place for customers to share their experience with your brand. Furthermore, your brand’s team has the ability to moderate questions and answers as well as reply to conversation strings so misinformation is avoided.</p><h2>The Secret to Successfully Displaying Social Proof</h2><p>Whether you choose to showcase user reviews in unique ways or prefer to go with standard practices is entirely up to you. After all, each brand's target audience has a different set of preferences and expectations, which means that your website's design and UX must actively meet consumer needs throughout the buyer journey.</p><p>But, understand that<a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/10-best-practices-to-encourage-customers-to-write-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\"> collecting and displaying user reviews</a> is one of the elementary aspects of a successful marketing strategy. So don't make the mistake of thinking that you can't benefit from the feedback you currently have. Even if what you have is just a couple of instances of UGC, a 4-star review with suggestions on how to improve your service, or the number of downloads your app got since launch, this social proof offers benefits when shown on your site. Even if it's just an opportunity to show future buyers that you care about their experiences and are committed to making them even better in the future.</p>",

In short, this platform sells and can be great for boosting sales. When a baked pasta recipe with feta cheese was trending, it created the \"<a href=\"https://hypebae.com/2021/3/tiktok-baked-feta-pasta-recipe-viral-trend-cheese-sales-shortage\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">great feta cheese shortage</a>\" in 2021— proving that the app is perfect for shopping.</p><p id=\"\">As an ecommerce business, tapping into this market can be highly lucrative. So, how can you make your brand stand out while becoming shoppable on TikTok? This article will break down a few ways to make shoppable content and earn those customers with Pixlee TurnTo.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Gain Traffic from TikTok by Product-Tagging</h2><p id=\"\">Tagging your products in your videos can drive conversions and traffic from TikTok. It makes shopping easier for your audience since they can easily access the product by tapping on the video. You would need an extensive product catalog with high quality images and compelling product descriptions.</p><p id=\"\">Once you have your product catalog ready, you would need to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1isefrS1OUOBNukfXezUX52v6LKniGsgQ/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">connect your brand’s TikTok account to Pixlee TurnTo</a>.

    "content": "<p>Social proof has always been a powerful digital marketing tool in the ecommerce arsenal. Product reviews; positive reviews (and <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/when-bad-reviews-are-a-good-thing-turnto-guidelines-and-checklist-of-best-practices-for-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes even negative</a>) boost your brand’s authenticity and improve sales.</p><p>Despite what some may think, product reviews led by influencers shouldn't be treated as an afterthought. You should be treating them as a central pillar of your content marketing strategy. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer marketing</a> encompasses a swathe of different tactics to improve your brand's engagement, as well as the sales and conversion rates of your products. Product reviews are the fastest way to convey a product’s quality while improving conversion, SEO, and brand trust. &nbsp;When these two powerhouses work together, your brand is poised for success.In the next five steps, you'll soon realize how much sway the power written word can have on the overall performance of your brand, especially when it comes from a trusted community source.</p><h2>1. Helps You Build Brand Trust</h2><p>A brand to be trusted is a brand that makes money. Around <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2019-06/2019_edelman_trust_barometer_special_report_in_brands_we_trust.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">81% of consumers</a> consider trust as a deal-breaker in leading to purchase from a brand. Improving your brand’s trustworthiness is a top priority if you want to <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/how-product-ratings-drive-ecommerce-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\">drive ecommerce conversions</a> through increased social proof.</p><p>‍<a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/customer-reviews-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">95% of customers</a> read reviews before making a purchase, and 72% won’t even take any buying actions until they’ve skimmed a product’s reviews. This shows that reviews are highly intertwined with brand and product trust.</p><p>Some reviews carry far greater sway than others; an endorsement of one of your products by a <a href=\"https://blog.pixlee.com/why-influencer-marketing-is-key-to-growing-your-retail-business-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">leading influencer</a> can have a greater impact than a review by an average customer. Followers are more likely to see themselves purchasing and enjoying products that their favorite influencers (rather than a stranger) recommend, so leveraging this can help with your marketing campaigns.</p><p>One of the key reasons is that influencers have followers who trust their opinions — they have an air of authenticity that is hard to match, and have skillfully built a following of individuals whose values and interests they share. An honest, positive review by an influencer about one of your products can increase sales to that audience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2504px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2504px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea051108095c732d63a96_Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.46.00-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>NAVY Hair Care uses TurnTo to collect and publish <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/checkout-comments\" target=\"_blank\">Checkout Comments</a>, customers’ answers to why they purchased a product. An overwhelming amount of these comments show that recommendations from influencers like Darylann Denner played a massive role in boosting sales. </p><h2>2. Helps You Build Niche Authority</h2><p>Most influencers, especially <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\">micro-influencers</a>, stick to a particular niche in terms of the products they promote and the reviews that they write. Make sure that the influencer you choose is relevant to your brand. You want to work with influencers who have authority among potential customers in your niche.</p><p>Micro-influencers and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-an-ambassador-marketing-program-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">brand ambassadors</a> often start as customers who are massive fans of your brand. These people are passionate about your brand, and may already be posting content related to your products or industry on social media. Once you can identify influencers who are genuinely interested in and familiar with your product, incentivize and encourage them to share their glowing reviews of your brand. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea051881bf129b6471277_image2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Youtuber Saffron Ellis focuses her videos around health, beauty, and apparel. In this video, she shares with her engaged audiences how a Dove product impacted her life positively.</p><p>You can utilize your <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">review service provider</a> to call out your influencer review(s) on-site, or they can share their sentiment through video testimonials and general social media posts. One of the best things about product reviews and influencer content are their flexibility; once you’ve got an influencer testimonial, share it on all of the marketing channels that your target audience may be exposed to.</p><h2>3. Useful in Influencer Marketing Campaigns</h2><p>An influencer marketing campaign is a proven way of giving your brand and products the exposure they need. One of the most common influencer marketing campaigns involves a brand offering their product or service to the influencer for free in exchange for a product or service review (among other forms of compensation).</p><p>One of the benefits of influencer-led content is that the parameters for these campaigns are endless; you can compensate influencers for a one-off social media post, or you can maintain a longer relationship with them and collaborate over time. The latter approach is more conducive to obtaining authentic and valuable product reviews from these influencers.Look for influencers in your industry whose values and style align with your brand. You can also use an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions-page-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing platform</a> like Pixlee to discover and manage relationships with new influencers.</p><p>You should seek to nurture relationships with relevant influencers in your niche. You can send these influencers a product or service to promote when you have a new offering. Such reviews are a hugely accessible and shareable way of promoting your products online. </p><h2>4. Boosts Your Social Media Presence</h2><p>Influencers love to post their latest blogs, vlogs, and product reviews on social media platforms, so working your brand into that narrative can drastically increase brand awareness within their audiences. <a href=\"https://www.augure.com/blog/state-influencer-engagement-20150618\" target=\"_blank\">93% of marketers</a> report seeing improved brand exposure through influencer engagement.</p><p>In addition to compensating influencers of your choice in exchange for their valuable product reviews, look for organic opportunities like micro-influencers or even just super loyal customers who regularly post about your brand and have the potential to become an advocate. Reviews from both influencers and everyday customers are a form of user-generated content, a content type that is highly advantageous in improving your brand’s social media KPIs. The engagement shouldn’t end with the influencer taking action by sharing their review on social media. As a company, you can interact with the influencer's post, liking and commenting yourself, which will lead to even more positive activity surrounding the product in mention. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1490px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1490px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea052fd076e35f146959f_image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Maui Jim reshares content from its top influencers on Instagram, quoting their testimonials in the post’s caption.

Boosts Conversions</h2><p>According to one study, around <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/consumer-confessions-how-does-ugc-impact-and-influence-the-shopping-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">81% of consumers</a> are influenced by product reviews as part of their buying behavior. Additionally, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">82% of consumers</a> say they are highly likely to follow a recommendation made by a micro-influencer.</p><p>This means that influencer-led product reviews can have a directly positive outcome on your conversions. &nbsp;Micro-influencers can generate <a href=\"http://go2.experticity.com/rs/288-AZS-731/images/Experticity-KellerFaySurveySummary_.pdf?_ga=2.222175320.1922164868.1515233850-1299873601.1515233850\" target=\"_blank\">22.2 times as many conversions</a> as other types of influencers because of their niche, focused audiences that often tend to be more engaged. This is good for your ecommerce strategy; the best individuals to reach out to for product reviews may not be the highest-in-demand or most expensive to partner with on a campaign!More product reviews lead to more purchases, giving you yet another reason to tap into the world of influencer product reviews. There’s no arguing with conversions either — if your business is making sales, then you’re putting yourself in a very healthy financial position.</p><p>Influencer product reviews are one of several marketing strategies that you can utilize to get the very best out of your business.</p><p>Rather than an afterthought, product reviews can lead to greater brand awareness, better social media presence, higher sales, and conversions, as well as promoting a general positive buzz around your products. Once you harness the benefits that reviews can bring to your brand, you’ll be well on your way to taking your business to the next level.</p>",

UGC generates trust, helps drive organic product discovery, and helps brands keep their homepages up to date. By using UGC, online retailers can reduce bounce rates and improve their overall performance. Here are five of the best examples of homepages using UGC to great effect.</p><h2>1. Old Navy</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.oldnavy.gap.com/\">Old Navy's homepage</a> invites customers to #sayhi on Instagram. The homepage features a gallery of the best images uploaded by Instagram Old Navy fans, as well as an upload tool that users can use to upload their own pictures from their computer, mobile device or Instagram account.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">If you’re familiar with influencer marketing, you probably know that finding the right influencers is one of the biggest challenges brands face.</p><p id=\"\">Should you work with a celebrity Instagrammer? What about a trendsetting YouTuber? Or would a blogging micro-influencer resonate best with your customer base?In this post, you’ll learn about some of the different types of influencers, and how to find the right influencers for your brand.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. The Celebrity Influencer</h3><p id=\"\">The celebrity influencer is a famous personality with a large-scale reach. They may be an actor, a musician, a socialite, a sportsperson, or anyone who has influence in mainstream media. There’s no denying that pop culture has a huge influence on consumers’ behavior and decisions. This is why some brands choose to work with celebrity influencers, who have a massive reach in popular media.</p><p id=\"\">Although working with these influencers may be expensive, they can offer a large reach, and major exposure for your brand, as well as high ROI. They’re ideal if you have no specific target audience, and simply want to raise brand awareness amongst the masses. They’re also the perfect influencers for you if you have several target demographics, spanning across various age groups and genders.</p><p id=\"\">The #BestDayEver campaign by Chevrolet is an excellent example of an influencer marketing campaign with celebrity influencers. The brand wanted to lift their reputation, and raise positive impressions by promoting a day filled with positivity. The campaign involved celebrities like Alec Baldwin and Olivia Wilde acting as substitute teachers at colleges, and Kelly Clarkson doing a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/583378376339169280\" id=\"\">surprise performance</a> in L.A.</p><p id=\"\">What an awesome day! Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chevrolet\" id=\"\">@chevrolet</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iHeartRadio\" id=\"\">@iHeartRadio</a> for this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BestDayEver?src=hash\" id=\"\">#BestDayEver</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/sponsored?src=hash\" id=\"\">#sponsored</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2UFCtzoiRS\" id=\"\">pic.twitter.com/2UFCtzoiRS</a></p><blockquote id=\"\">— Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/583378376339169280\" id=\"\">April 1, 2015</a></blockquote><h3 id=\"\">2. The Trendsetter Influencer</h3><p id=\"\">Trendsetting influencers are most popular in the fields of beauty, fashion, entertainment, and technology. They lead the way in their respective fields, and are often known to set new trends, and get others to follow along. These influencers aren’t necessarily individuals, but can also be publishers, like BuzzFeed, Nat Geo Travel, E! Online, etc.</p><p id=\"\">Partnering with a trendsetting influencer is ideal if you’re going to launch a new tech product; line of clothing, accessories, or beauty products; or an entirely new invention. They’re the right type of influencers if you’re mainly targeting an audience of teenages and young adults online or on social media, where these influencers have major influence.</p><p id=\"\">Social media stars are some of the best brand influencers to work with. Mercedes Benz did a great job of partnering with Instagram-famous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loki_the_wolfdog/?hl=en\" id=\"\">Loki the Wolfdog</a>, who has a following of 1.3 million. Loki, and his owner Kelly Lund went on a trip to the snowy mountains of Colorado, driving a 2017 Mercedes GLS. The pair provided users with a 360° experience of their adventure with another camera showcasing the car’s interiors.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.25%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div id=\"\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVNylwQRUQM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">3. The Expert Influencer</h3><p id=\"\">Experts and gurus are some of the best types of influencers to work with. They are knowledgeable in their area of expertise, and have a massive following of people who are interested in what they have to say.</p><p id=\"\">Their followers look to them for guidance and recommendations regarding their purchases. So they can help you convince your target audience to <a href=\"https://blog.pixlee.com/how-to-win-millennials-brand-loyalty\">trust your brand</a>, and buy your products.</p><p id=\"\">The best part is that you can find an influential expert in almost every field – whether it’s technology, gaming, fashion, beauty, food, marketing, or even finance. Their followings are comprised of people who have an interest in their field of expertise, and may even know quite a bit about said field.</p><p id=\"\">This means that partnering with experts or gurus can be ideal if you want to reach an audience who already has some knowledge about your niche, and who is open to new ideas and tips for further learning. When you’re targeting this type of audience, the goal should be to have an expert validate the value or need of your product or service.</p><p id=\"\">For example, you can partner with an influential figure in the marketing industry if you’re promoting some technology or software to help marketers. This influencer will be able to reach an audience of novice and expert marketers, who are most likely to be interested in your product.</p><p id=\"\">Startup beauty retailer <a href=\"https://campfire-capital.com/beauty/memebox-raises-66-million/\" id=\"\">Memebox</a> managed to raise their year-over-year revenue by 670% by partnering with popular beauty experts. The influencers helped start a trend for the use of the brand’s makeup products.</p><p id=\"\">Memebox also created a new line of products, Pony Effect, in partnership with Korean beauty vlogger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT-_4GqC-yLY1xtTHhwY0hA\" id=\"\">Pony</a>, who has more than 2 million YouTube subscribers, and 3 million followers on Instagram. When Memebox released a new eyeshadow from the Pony Effect line late last year, they sold 20,000 units in just 45 minutes.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:640px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"640px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bab6a87af8ad9fd801a8_memebox-pony-shine-on-easy-glam.jpeg\" alt=\"memebox-pony-shine-on-easy-glam.jpg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">4. The Blogger Influencer</h3><p id=\"\">Like influential experts, influential bloggers are also very knowledgeable about their fields of expertise. For example, there are mommy bloggers, who provide fellow mothers and parents with parenting advice, and product recommendations. And style bloggers, who update fans with the latest fashion trends and tips.</p><p id=\"\">Blogger influencers are part expert, part trendsetter. They set trends, and are also considered experts in their niches. Their audiences consider them to be trustworthy sources of advice, and recommendations, which gives them a great deal of influence over the purchase decisions of their followers.</p><p id=\"\">Working with a blogger influencer is ideal if you want to reach a niche audience, and drive more conversions. These influencers can write sponsored posts, and promote giveaways for your products, helping you engage a highly-targeted audience. They can not only help raise awareness about your products, but also validate their need and value through reviews and how-to’s.</p><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"https://www.staubusa.com/\" id=\"\">Staub</a> promoted a giveaway of their cookware through influential food blogs like <a href=\"https://www.loveandlemons.com/staub-cookware-giveaway/\" id=\"\">Love &amp; Lemons</a>. In the post, the blogger provided readers with a short narrative about why she loves the brand’s cookware. She also posted details about the contest, and invited readers to participate.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1257px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1257px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bab6e40fd0991a3df897_Staub-Love-Lemons.png\" alt=\"Staub-Love-Lemons.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">5. The Advocate Influencer</h3><p id=\"\">An advocate may be one of your most valuable assets for marketing your brand. People trust recommendations coming from other consumers, so you can build trust in your brand by leveraging your influential customers. Although they may not have as much influence or reach as celebrity influencers or experts, they’re considered trustworthy for purchase recommendations and often have <a href=\"https://digiday.com/agencies/micro-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">higher levels of engagement than other influencers. </a>In addition to your loyal customers, you can also look for influential fans. These are <a href=\"https://shanebarker.com/blog/micro-influencers-guide/\" id=\"\">micro-influencers</a> who are already fans of your brand or products.</p><p id=\"\">They have a significant reach, which can help boost your brand’s visibility. They’re also considered knowledgeable in their respective niches, meaning your target audience will deem their recommendations trustworthy. It’s ideal to work with brand advocates if you’re trying to win the trust of a new audience.</p><p id=\"\">Old Navy uses customer photos as testimonials to tell the stories of influential customers. In this case, the brand was able to combine different types of influencers by working with existing fans, fashion influencers, and a trendsetters in the fashion industry.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1319px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1319px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bab6c3d1926767b35340_Old-Navy.png\" alt=\"Old-Navy.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Now that you know more about the different types of social influencers, you should have a better idea which of them will resonate best with your brand’s customer base. When choosing an influencer to work with, it’s important to consider your customer base, but make sure you take into account the specific goals of your campaign as well.</p><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanebarker\" id=\"\">Shane Barker</a> is a digital marketing consultant who specializes in influencer marketing, product launches, and website conversions.

The human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text. No wonder your audience prefers pictures – they get the information they’re looking for faster.</p><p>Beyond the speed of image processing, the human brain forms its first impression <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/visual-content-marketing-16-eye-popping-statistics-you-need-to-know.html\">in 50 milliseconds</a>. Using visual marketing, you can make sure that first impression is a positive one. It’s much harder to do the same with blocks of text. A visual channel is a more efficient conduit of your brand’s message.</p><p>You want consumers to form an immediate positive impression of your brand, but don’t you also want to make a memorable impression?

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Ambassador marketing has proven to be beneficial for businesses across a variety of different industries. This marketing strategy is similar to the widely-popular realm of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a> campaigns. Unlike influencers, however, ambassadors commit to working with a company long-term. They’ll integrate your products or services into their daily lives and promote them in the same way that they would recommend a company to a friend. Here’s why you should take advantage of this area of marketing.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. People Trust Word-of-Mouth Marketing Over Branded Content</h2><p id=\"\">The world of advertising has changed in recent years. Word-of-mouth marketing generates more than <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\">twice the sales</a> of paid advertising, and <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/under-the-influence-consumer-trust-in-advertising.html\" target=\"_blank\">84% of consumers</a> say they trust peer recommendations above all other sources of advertising.</p><p id=\"\">Nowadays, most people put the highest level of trust in word-of-mouth recommendations over other forms of marketingSo, if you have ambassadors who have built a lot of trust with their fans, their recommendations can be very valuable.</p><p id=\"\">Bloggers, online stars, and celebrities tend to have a lot of sway over the perceptions of their followers, and a well-planned ambassador marketing campaign can help you <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-get-your-product-in-front-of-10-million-people-on-social/\" target=\"_blank\">get your product in front of 10 million people</a> on social media. And some of those people are sure to give your brand a chance when your carefully-chosen ambassadors show their genuine support for your products or services.</p><p id=\"\">In this way, brand ambassadors can have a huge positive impact on your company’s sales. </p><h2 id=\"\">2. Ambassadors Have a Vested Interest in Sharing Referrals</h2><p id=\"\">Ambassador marketing is a two-way street, which means your chosen ambassadors should benefit too. Companies will typically send their ambassadors free products to try out, so they can then promote their favorites online. If their lives are genuinely improved by your products or services, they’ll be happy, and this will shine through in their social media efforts.</p><p id=\"\">You can also agree on compensation you’ll pay your ambassadors for shouting about your products over a set amount of time. But, if you really want them to help you make lots of new sales, it can also be worth incentivizing them through an affiliate program with sales-related commission on top of this. This will ensure your ambassadors are given an additional monetary reward whenever they successfully convince someone to purchase your products or services. Providing each ambassador with a unique discount code to share with their fans is a great way to track which purchases map back to which ambassador.</p><p id=\"\">You might have already seen some companies providing referral rewards and affiliate marketing schemes. These schemes aren’t strictly open to brand ambassadors, but they can still provide you with some inspiration for how to incentivize the people you choose to work with. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1856px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1856px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a41033385dd4fc328ce_Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-2.19.45-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Colombia-based intimates brand <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/leonisa\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Leonisa</a> offers free membership to its affiliate program, and provides commission to ambassadors based on link clicks and sales.</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">‍</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a42f874323d4c53768a_image3-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.sportsmansguide.com/event?key=guide-ambassadors\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sportsman’s Guide’s affiliate ambassador program</a> features a diverse range of “guides” who can choose from one of two comission partnerships and feature links and products from the brand on social media or their personal websites. In turn, these ambassadors make revenue for each sale that originates from their content.</p><p id=\"\">Online shoppers can easily access each guide’s Instagram page and explore their experiences with Sportsman’s Guide’s products.</p><p id=\"\">Of course, ambassadors are typically people who are working with you on more of an official basis, but incorporating a referral or affiliate strategy into your arrangements can help to drive more sales. If an ambassador is going to receive an extra commission every time one of their followers makes a purchase, they’ll try even harder to push your products or services. If you’re interested in going down this route, Pixlee has a great <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-setup-and-run-an-ecommerce-referral-program/\" target=\"_blank\">guide</a> to setting up and running your own ecommerce referral program, which has all of the tips you’ll need to get started.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Ambassadors Offer a Middle Ground Between Branded and User-Generated Content</h2><p id=\"\">Creating high-quality content can take a lot of time and energy. So, it’s worth ensuring that any agreements you make with brand ambassadors allow you to reuse the content that they create in promoting your products or services. They could provide you with images, written content, testimonials, or even social media content to publish. Brand ambassadors will often be content creators in their own right, so being able to utilize some of their creative prowess for your own marketing materials can be highly beneficial. Using their talent to the fullest can greatly expand your available content marketing resources. Some companies rely heavily on <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a>, posts already shared by loyal customers on social media, for their online marketing strategy, and you can use ambassador content in a similar way. With an influencer program boasting over 10,000 passionate ambassadors, athletic apparel brand <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/hylete\" target=\"_blank\">HYLETE</a> also prioritizes re-sharing content from happy customers in HYLETE gear.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1224px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1224px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a415a12756cc5521489_Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-2.27.59-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">HYLETE shares a community post from an Instagram user participating in a TikTok-inspired flexibility challenge while rocking HYLETE apparel.</p><p id=\"\">Whenever you bring a new brand ambassador on board, you should give them some guidelines on what kinds of content you would like them to create so you can share it. For instance, perhaps you have a particular colour scheme you use for your brand images, which you would like them to replicate. Provide them with all of the information they’ll need to create high-quality content you’ll be happy to share or use on your own channels. Here’s a more detailed explanation of why this <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/why-user-generated-content-marketing-works/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated style of content marketing really works</a> in today’s advertising environment.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Ambassadors Will Measurably Improve Your KPIs</h2><p id=\"\">Elementary marketing fact: the more people that know about your business, the more sales you’ll make. Brand ambassadors will all have their own circles and communities of people who might be interested in hearing about your products or services. And, because they will have built trust within these circles, people will be very receptive to their recommendations. This means that whenever one of your ambassadors mentions your products or services, it will help to improve people’s awareness and perception of your brand quite quickly. This can improve your overall brand awareness, but it can also deliver some powerful metrics to let you measure the effect of ambassador programs in real-time. One of these is the conversion rate: the percentage of interested visitors who make a purchase and become loyal customers. With an affiliate link model, the conversion rate of each brand ambassador can be tracked individually. As demonstrated in Pixlee’s article about the <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-what-why-and-how-of-brand-awareness/\" target=\"_blank\">what, why, and how of brand awareness</a>, people are more likely to buy from a company they’re familiar with than one they’ve never heard of. This lends itself to higher conversion rates on links promoted by ambassadors. Additionally, potential customers that you reach through an influencer that they relate to are likely to have a higher brand affinity or general positive association with the brand. This indicator can be measured through exit surveys or post-purchase satisfaction surveys connected to promoted links. It’s also worth noting that recruiting brand ambassadors can be great for your SEO, as it could lead to you building lots of different <a href=\"https://loganix.com/types-of-backlinks/\" target=\"_blank\">types of backlinks</a> to your website. When search engines like Google see that a lot of authoritative sites have linked to your website content, they’ll take this as a sign that you’re a trustworthy source of information and will start sending more people your way.</p><p id=\"\">So, while a lot of people focus on recruiting social media stars to promote their products or services, it’s also worth considering bloggers and journalists who are more likely to have their own websites as well. Track your search engine rankings throughout your campaigns, and it’s likely you’ll see them improve. These are just some of the many ways that social media influencers can <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-social-media-influencers-make-or-break-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\">make or break your business</a>, so make sure to decide in advance what an ambassador marketing campaign means for your organization and how you plan to measure its success.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Your Brand Halo Will Grow</h2><p id=\"\">Every company will have a different idea of what a successful brand ambassador campaign looks likes. But, ultimately, you’ll want to forge a strong relationship that’s mutually beneficial, and that helps your business to grow. To give you an idea of what a successful ambassador campaign can look like, let’s take a look at some companies that have gotten it right. Yakima Racks, an outdoor equipment retailer, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/building-a-powerful-brand-ambassador-program-featuring-sylvia-choi-of-yakima/\" target=\"_blank\">builds strong relationships</a> with diverse adventurers who use their products.

The company promotes their stories and successes as part of an ongoing demonstration of what Yakima products can help you to achieve when put to the test. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1402px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1402px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a4072c3888399b8b6e3_image2-copy-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Professional snowboarder and RackPack member Robin Van Gyn shares her experience with Yakima’s car rack and how it improves her outdoor adventures.</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">‍</p><h2 id=\"\">Growing Brand Communities with Ambassadors</h2><p id=\"\">A brand ambassador program could provide the boost your business’s marketing needs.

The inactivity can also impact your credibility and signal that you don’t take an active interest in your customers. Not only will you end up losing your existing customers by failing to maintain a community on social media, but you will also find it difficult to get the attention of new prospects. Even though it may feel tempting to delete all social media accounts and get a fresh start, it is not ideal. You will lose your existing username (which can be hard to get because they are allotted on a first-come, first-serve basis), follower list, and even the posts you have created. Luckily, there are ways to resuscitate your accounts without having to start over completely. Read on for tips to keep in mind while revamping your social strategy.</p><h2>1. Evaluate Your Existing Content and Community Strategies</h2><p>The first step is to be brutally honest with yourself and find out why the social media presence of your business becomes inactive. Was it lack of time or absence of a solid strategy or frustration because you never got any results that led you to abandon all activity? Having clarity about the reason will help you stay on track when you start afresh. Take note of which existing pieces of content generated engagement from your followers, and whether or not you’ve maintained a consistent brand voice throughout your posting history. Continue any tactics that have worked in the past while implementing new strategies like asking your followers questions, employing diverse content types, familiarizing yourself with new features like social video on your platforms, and responding to comments from your fans.</p><p>Reply to any comments you receive on the new posts and harness the momentum. Also, use social listening to monitor brand mentions and stay engaged with your followers. Tracking the performance of your posts consistently can help you make improvements.</p><p>As you reshape your approach to social content, remember to keep community at the forefront of your marketing efforts. Nobody wants to follow an account that posts robotically about making sales — they want to be a part of a community.</p><h2>2. Market Community-First With User-Generated Content (UGC)</h2><p>Building brand community on social media starts with humanizing the content you share online. One of the best ways to avoid appearing overly salesy with your social content is by sharing UGC from your existing customers. This media created by fans brings an element of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/is-social-proof-marketing-the-next-big-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">social proof</a> to your marketing and contextualizes your product by showing it in action.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1656px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1656px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ae733cc12397f05b68f_farrow-and-ball-ugc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Farrow &amp; Ball inspires its followers by sharing photos from its community featuring the brand’s paint. A post like this requires minimal effort on the brand side, as the team sources content from its own followers.</p><p>Use your social profiles to encourage followers to share posts related to your products or brand — you can even create a brand hashtag to keep track of this content as it’s posted. Incentivize fans by featuring UGC on your brand’s profile, or hold a <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-running-a-social-media-contest/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic\" target=\"_blank\">social media contest</a> to reward submissions. It’s also worth it to look into a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">CRM platform like Pixlee</a> to automatically collect and publish UGC across your most impactful marketing channels like email and website displays in addition to social media.</p><h2>3. Delete Duplicate or Inactive Accounts</h2><p>If you are serious about bouncing back from the dead, you’ll need to perform an audit to locate all the social media accounts linked to your brand. While this may seem like the easiest task in the world, you’ll be surprised how many inactive accounts you may have created on a whim to keep up with the trends.</p><p>You may also spot several unofficial accounts set up either by employees who were in charge of social media activity previously, or by spammers. So make sure to perform a thorough search for your brand on all the major social networks and weed out all <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-run-a-fake-instagram-followers-audit/\" target=\"_blank\">fake accounts</a>. This process is another form of social listening. It is also advisable to take stock of the number of social media platforms where you are located. Ask yourself why you are using this platform, what goals you wish to achieve, and whether your target customers are active. If you don’t find a compelling reason to maintain the account because the platform is not aligned to your goals and the target market is elsewhere, delete it and spend your efforts elsewhere. </p><h2>4. Use Influencers to Create Buzz Around Your Social Revival</h2><p>Most marketers know influencer marketing is hugely beneficial in boosting brand awareness on social media. Begin by finding the right one — whether that’s investing in an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-an-ambassador-marketing-program-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">ambassador program</a> (a longer-term partnership, often with more than one individual), <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencers-in-2021-8-things-brands-should-know/\" target=\"_blank\">micro-influencers</a>, or a larger creator — and building a relationship with them. Pixlee’s <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions-page-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer Marketing</a> platform also allows brands to discover influencers whose audience and values align with your brand’s.</p><p>Once you’ve <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-savvy-tips-to-find-the-perfect-influencer-for-your-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">found the right influencer</a>, work with them to create a campaign surrounding your brand’s return to social media. You may choose to contract them for a one-off post about a product, or design a more involved campaign like a social media contest to spread awareness about your brand account. However you choose to spark engagement and impressions for your brand account, make sure you give the influencer creative freedom — after all, they know their audience best.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1928px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1928px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ae7b3c7bc473d6ee330_Screen-Shot-2021-11-09-at-4.12.43-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Everlane uses influencers like @kc_doubletake, giving them unique affiliate discount codes to incentivize their own followers to shop with the brand and check out its social profiles.</p><h2>5. Hire a Social Media Manager</h2><p>Building a social media presence is no walk in the park. Juggling it with your existing responsibilities as a business owner can become overwhelming. That’s why the most successful brands delegate social media tasks to one individual — a social media manager. This individual (ideally working with a team, but that’s not always possible for smaller brands) has the opportunity to harness a voice and style for your brand while regularly engaging with prospects on the channels your target audience is most active on. Having that one person show up consistently through your brand’s profiles shows your team’s appreciation for its online community. Moreover, the social media landscape is continuously changing, and having a manager on board can help you keep track of any algorithm changes and new trends on various platform. Your social media strategy can be tweaked according to new features, opportunities, and activity on your channels of choice to receive the desired engagement. </p><h2>Ready to up your social media game again?</h2><p>Even if your once-active social media presence has gone flat, it is not too late to return with a spark. Make sure to implement these tips and start building up a genuine community with new tools to support you.</p><p>‍<em>Gladys Labsan is a writer with over 10 years of professional experience on various topics under the sun.

    "content": "<p>A growing number of marketers are tapping into the power of Instagram to tell their brand story. With features such as Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and video uploads, Instagram offers plenty of ways to share a brand’s message to a large, yet targeted audience.</p><p>Instagram is a social media platform dominated by the digitally native millennial – <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/mobile-messaging-and-social-media-2015/2015-08-19_social-media-update_09/\">55% of all online 18-29 year-olds</a> in the U.S. are active users. It has also emerged as the most engaging of social media platforms, with an engagement rate 58x more than Facebook and 129x times that of Twitter.</p><p>The social platform can be an economical way to build your brand's reputation and following. A whole new generation of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/download/the-top-digitally-native-brands-report-for-2017\">digital vertical brands</a> (such as Glossier and MVMT Watches) have launched into stardom on Instagram, building cult-like followings and turning entire industries on their heads.</p><p>‍<strong>How do you build and tell your brand story on Instagram? To get started, here are five ways to create and showcase your unique brand story on the platform. </strong></p><h2><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Provide a unique and engaging visual experience</strong></h2><p>Instagram is an inherently visual platform. Building a consistent and unique brand experience is essential to establishing your online brand identity.</p><p>There are certain photography tactics that every brand can leverage to create high-quality, high-performing <a href=\"https://envato.com/cm/instagram-story-templates/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram photos</a>. These include focusing on lighting, picking one central subject, looking for patterns, and not overdoing your filters. Apps such as <a href=\"http://vsco.co/\">VSCO</a> or <a href=\"http://afterlight.us/\">AfterLight</a> can help with correcting lighting, exposure, and more.</p><h2><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Share behind-the-scenes images of your brand, your people, and events</strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/2/#4188165642b8\">Millennials are the first generation to be truly open not only to receiving ads, but also to engaging and sharing them</a>. To optimize on this generational characteristic, consider sourcing content from your customers. User-generated content, which in layman’s terms just means real customer photos and videos, can add transparency to your brand and its products. Using real images of your customers and your product \"in the wild\" can inspire sale: placing <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/download/the-use-cases-of-user-generated-content\">real customer photos on your website is proven to increase conversion by 2X.</a> &nbsp;</p><p>Why? 92% of customers trust their peers over your brand.</p><p>Consider arranging an Instagram takeover. Hand over the reins of your Instagram account to a social influencer who sports your brand and has a similar audience to attract the attention of their fans and followers. Showcasing your brand from a different angle might help to attract new customers and audiences.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:562px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"562px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cece3aad836cfb46e207b_Instagram1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Make use of Instagram Live and Instagram Stories </strong></h2><p>Instagram Live and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewong/2016/08/03/instagram-stories-sends-a-clear-message-to-digital-marketers/\">Instagram Stories</a> are two powerful features that allow you to deepen your connection with your followers and tell your brand story in a fun and more authentic way. Instagram has evolved into the place to post highly stylized, curated photos of “perfect moments.” With the introduction of these features, Instagram looked to “lower the bar for sharing all types of photos and video — and not just the carefully planned and painstakingly touched-up photographs that are typical of the service,” said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/technology/instagram-stories-snapchat-facebook.html?_r=1\">Kevin Systrom</a>, co-founder and CEO of Instagram.</p><p>Instagram Live or Instagram Stories can give a behind-the-scenes look at brand-sponsored events, office culture, or tutorials for your products. Try using Instagram or Snapchat stories to highlight current sales and highlighting customer photos.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:325px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"325px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cece4a2de32fae526cdef_Instagram2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:323px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"323px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cece433ecaf49bf4de956_Instagram3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>4. Connect your Brand with a Cause</strong></h2><p>For a brand to thrive, it’s necessary for it to not only align but to embed itself into customer relationships that go beyond its product offering. What this means is: Don't be afraid to support a cause. Millennials connect with brands that support the causes that they care about. &nbsp;</p><p>‍<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/05/three-myths-about-customer-eng\">Sixty-four percent</a> say shared values are the main reason they have a relationship with a brand and <a href=\"http://blog.pixlee.com/why-authenticity-is-key-for-brand-marketing\">74% believe authentic brands</a> are the ones that care about something greater than their bottom line.Extra kudos if you can align yourself with a cause that your target audience cares about. In the outdoor industry, you hear a lot about ‘the tribe’ and the culture of the community. Particularly, you hear about brands wanting customers to believe in what they stand for, not just to buy their products. &nbsp;</p><p>Try not just to align, but to embed your brand into customer relationships that go beyond the product offering.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cece396844479a372fe11_Instagram4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>5. Use Instagram contests and campaigns</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\">Social media contests</a> are a powerful way for businesses to engage their customers. They are the fastest way to increase engagement on social media. While brands may decide to launch an Instagram marketing campaign for a variety of reasons (i.e., build a robust Instagram community, launch a new product, etc.) it is ultimately looking to increase brand awareness, customer engagement, and brand affinity.In order to run a successful social media marketing campaign, be sure to:</p><ol> \t<li>Set your campaign goals</li> \t<li>Choose your social networks</li> \t<li>Engage with participants</li> \t<li>Display collected content from participants</li> \t<li>Measure and analyze your campaign’s success</li></ol><p>By analyzing your campaign’s submissions, you may uncover surprising new information, such as how your customers are actually using your products post-purchase, and accumulate valuable user-generated content to display across other marketing channels.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:415px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"415px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cece45802af21ddad57f5_Instagram5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Instagram is an ideal social platform for building and telling your brand story in an engaging and authentic manner.

Aerie set out to emphasize the impact that edited photos can have on women’s self-esteem and instead, wanted to promote a sense of body positivity.</p><p>The brand took to Instagram and pledged to stop retouching photos of models. They also challenged users to post unedited photos of themselves in bathing suits with the hashtag #AerieReal.</p><p>And for every Instagram post, Aerie donates $1 to <a href=\"https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/\">National Eating Disorders Association</a> (NEDA).</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/australia/\">Tourism Australia</a></h2><p>Tourism Australia knows that everyone loves sharing their vacation photos and video with friends and family. When they noticed that massive amounts of content with the hashtag #SeeAustralia were being shared on social media, they realized it was a great opportunity to bring travelers into the conversation. By highlighting the experience of traveling in Australia they created a community of both those who had been there and those who aspired to visit.</p><p>Running <a href=\"http://www.tourism.australia.com/en/about/our-campaigns/theres-nothing-like-australia.html\">multiple activations</a>, including the Giga Selfie campaign aimed at attracting younger and social media savvy Japanese consumers, and their aquatic and coastal campaigns,Tourism Australia has found ways to continue to engage and stay relevant. In addition to the beautiful and highly visual generated content they are collecting, for one campaign they saw a <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/tourism-australia-managing-ugc-generating-authentic-customer-experiences-adobe-livefyre/\">30% increase in site engagement and a 66% increase in time spent on site</a>.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stuartweitzman/?hl=en\">Stuart Weitzman</a></h2><p>The shoe company Stuart Weitzman recently launched the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/eyelove/\">#EYELOVE</a> campaign in collaboration with it girl of the moment/supermodel, Gigi Hadid.The campaign highlights a new shoe collection with a good cause—building schools in Ghana, Guatemala, and Laos through its partnership with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pencilsofpromise/\">Pencils of Promise</a>. This UGC encourages people to support the campaign to provide life-changing education.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gigihadid/\">Gigi Hadid</a> and Stuart Weitzman joined forces to create the “Gigi Boot,” which has helped fund the building of three schools. This year, they're doubling down on their efforts with a new collection.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/underarmour/?hl=en\">Under Armour</a></h2><p>In July 2017, Under Armour <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/under-armour-launches-unlike-any-a-new-global-campaign-celebrating-women-who-are-beyond-compare-300490859.html\">launched a new global campaign</a> entitled “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/unlikeany/\">Unlike Any</a>” celebrating women who are beyond compare.</p><p>The campaign is a collaboration between spoken word artists, and it was designed to celebrate and honor the unprecedented achievements of female athletes that rise above gender comparisons and stand on their own.</p><p>The origins of this campaign were inspired by an unsettling revelation at the Rio Summer Olympics. At the launch of the new campaign, Adrienne Lofton, Senior VP of global brand management said, “Every time a woman won, she was compared to men.</p><p>”And from there, she stated, there was this need to change the conversation. A need to remove gender from the dialogue and focus on women's contributions on their own merit.</p><p>The second part of this, was a need to break the perception of who Under Armour was as a brand. The campaign was meant to highlight that their athletic wear is for all women.</p><p>In partnership with Droga5, they created a fantastic and empowering campaign featuring the likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLC5tgvuNxfsJIj2OMZbLKDVcmLifLq5l3%3Fecver%3D2&v=IFigcXV05Vw\">Misty Copeland </a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLC5tgvuNxfsJIj2OMZbLKDVcmLifLq5l3%3Fecver%3D2&v=3WFrHNYLApk\">Natasha Hastings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLC5tgvuNxfsJIj2OMZbLKDVcmLifLq5l3%3Fecver%3D2&v=1hESinLoW6A\">Alison Désir</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLC5tgvuNxfsJIj2OMZbLKDVcmLifLq5l3%3Fecver%3D2&v=pFwMg_WKnXg\">Jessie Graff</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLC5tgvuNxfsJIj2OMZbLKDVcmLifLq5l3%3Fecver%3D2&v=3YVjaJhu8Vs\">Zoe Zhang</a>.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/?hl=en\">National Geographic</a></h2><p>As the leading global brand in terms of Instagram followers, it stands to reason that National Geographic would be a master at leveraging user-generated content. With the launch of their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wanderlustcontest/\">#WanderlustContest</a> in 2015, which prompted users to post photos for the chance to win a National Geographic photo expedition to Yosemite National Park, they created an immense, interactive slideshow on their website. Utilizing both their own site and social media effectively, the hashtag has generated over 63K post on Instagram.</p><p>Truly a brand that understands the connection between <a href=\"https://nrf.com/blog/how-nat-geo-connects-content-community-and-commerce\">content, community, and commerce</a>, National Geographic provides a case study in how an iconic, 130 tear old brand has adapted to changing technology and trends. In order to share photos on the website, users must join the National Geographic's Your Shot Community, where <a href=\"http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/tags/wanderlust/\">#wanderlust</a> and other hashtags such as <a href=\"http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/tags/citylights/\">#citylights</a>, <a href=\"http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/tags/protecttheselands/\">#protecttheselands</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/tags/myclimateaction/\">#myclimateaction</a> continue to thrive.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/netflix/?hl=en\">Netflix</a></h2><p>Creating buzz around their new releases is a vital part of Netflix’s social media strategy. As the brand leans more heavily on creating original programming, they've increasingly looked toward UGC to promote their content.</p><p>Netflix promotes fans' posts about shows and movies with straightforward hashtags (using the shows’ titles) to spread the word of upcoming premieres. These actions inspire Instagram users coming across Netflix’s page to see what the fuss is all about, as UGC shows how others are already engaged and impatiently waiting for new content. For example, one of 2017's most highly anticipated shows <em>Stranger Things</em> Season 2 generated nearly 1 million posts on Instagram using #strangerthings2, and was also dubbed the \"<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-2-twitter-record/\">most-Tweeted about streaming series</a>\" when it debuted last Fall. By re-purposing some of the show's user-generated buzz in it's marketing, Netflix was able to engage with and built community.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adobe/?hl=en\">Adobe</a></h2><p>Hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/adobe_perspective/\">#AdobePerspective</a> is used by the creative software company Adobe. The hashtag serves as a way for the artists and content creators who use the Adobe Suite to share their content, as well as source work for free from other users.</p><p>With this UGC campaign, Adobe gets to show off its software capabilities while engaging with its community of users. Many of the Adobe programs come with a steep learning curve, and new users may have some trouble envisioning what they can do with the software before seeing it in action.</p><p>Adobe doesn't stop there. The campaign, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/adobe_incolor/\">#Adobe_InColor</a> is the company's Pride Month-themed UGC campaign that generated 300 posts in first the first few weeks of June 2017.</p><p>Adobe is an excellent example of UGC, as their campaigns showcase the talents of their users, as well as the values culture of its community. This gives them a leg up on the competition, as their UGC feels especially authentic.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As consumers become less and less swayed by traditional advertising, marketers will continue to look outside of the sales funnel and turn toward UGC to boost credibility and reach. With that in mind, there's no doubt the influence of UGC is going strong. We're likely to see more of it in <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/3-ugc-marketing-trends-on-the-rise-in-2018/\">2018, and beyond</a>, as more brands tap into the power of their community.</p><p>Learn the ropes of user-generated content marketing. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/product#request\">Request a free Pixlee demo</a> and we’ll show you around.</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">93% of marketers</a> who use video say it’s an important element of their overall strategy, and this percentage has been steadily increasing over the last several years. With the widespread adoption of video by brands and social channels (think Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat) today, knowing how to stand out from a saturated market is your key to success.</p><p id=\"\">So how do you get social users to notice your brand’s videos? The answer lies in influencer marketing; featuring trusted individuals with a curated, loyal following in video campaigns sets your brand up to be memorable and trusted.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we'll reveal the benefits of working with video influencers and talk about seven types of video campaigns to consider this year for breakthrough awareness, authenticity, and conversion.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Influencer-Led Video Campaigns?</h2><p id=\"\">While a customizable <a href=\"https://crello.com/unlimited/videos/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">stock video clip</a> can be a useful tool for demonstrating your product or brand story, collaboration with influencers can boost your marketing results by far. <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">76% of marketers</a> consider influencer engagement effective in garnering customer loyalty, as their followers trust them for genuine product recommendations and brand reviews.</p><p id=\"\">Influencer content also provides social proof, making users more likely to buy products they’ve used and loved themselves. This is similar to user-generated content (UGC), which is <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">35% more memorable</a> and 50% more trusted than other media. Both influencers and UGC bring an emotional appeal to purchase that brand content often does not. Influencer video content is custom-made and looks authentic, grabbing attention and encouraging purchasing decisions through an immediate impact. Plus, it provides you with regular new content assets about your products in search engines, saving time and budgets on content production.</p><h2 id=\"\">Influencer Video Campaigns in 2022 </h2><p id=\"\">Once you decide on the right social platform for your audience and discover influencers to collaborate with, it's time to agree upon the <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/lp/create/video-making-guide/plan-a-project/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">video types</a> they will create to communicate your brand vision and products. To streamline this overall process, consider using an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a> platform like Pixlee TurnTo to discover, manage, compensate, and track success metrics of influencer campaigns. Check out these 10 influencer video ideas:</p><h3 id=\"\">1) <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/unboxing-videos-an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-sourcing-creating-and-monetizing-unboxing-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">Unboxing Videos</a></h3><p id=\"\">We all enjoy opening presents, and that's why unboxing campaigns are so appealing for users and beneficial for brand awareness and engagement. In this video style, an influencer opens up a product box from a brand and shares impressions about its features with the audience.</p><p id=\"\">When done right, <a href=\"https://packhelp.co.uk/unboxing-phenomenon-why-people-watch-unpacking-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">unboxing videos create awareness</a>, promote seasonal deals, and attract viewers closer to buying decisions.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2112px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2112px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be83a98aa8baf9578f3_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-1.08.58-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">YouTuber Alexandria Ryan posts an unboxing video showing apparel brand FabFitFun’s products. The brand also takes this relationship a step further by using an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-setup-and-run-an-ecommerce-referral-program/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ecommerce referral program</a> for creator compensation; Alexandria lists her unique discount code in the video description.</p><h3 id=\"\">2) Product Placements</h3><p id=\"\">This one is among the most common yet effective types of influencer video campaigns. Work out the payment amount and method for your influencer, and then collaborate with them on social posts incorporating your product in a positive light.</p><p id=\"\">The trick here is not about directly promoting a brand's product and telling about it but placing it into a video's context organically and naturally. It’s absolutely essential to give your influencers creative freedom when formulating their posts; while you can offer guidance on how to speak about your brand and products, they’re the ones who ultimately know how to resonate with their followers well.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1542px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1542px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be872c38815f6b8ca78_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-4.01.09-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Milani Cosmetics reshares a video originally posted by influencer @glow_bymonica on Instagram. Milani, like many other creator-focused brands, uses Pixlee for Creators to create and launch influencer campaigns across social media, website pages, email, and more.</p><h3 id=\"\">3) Product Reviews</h3><p id=\"\">Product reviews are common influencer video content types, but they differ slightly from unboxing videos.. While unboxing is about emotions and impressions about a product, reviews are about informative descriptions of a product's features, usage, and benefits. This video content type is popular among YouTubers, although the influencers on other social platforms like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-ways-we-wish-more-brands-would-use-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-tiktok-campaigns-you-need-to-try-in-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">TikTok</a> create product reviews as well.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1316px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1316px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be8057fb521e585ff3f_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-3.53.29-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">A fitness influencer rating Alo Yoga’s skincare products on TikTok scores the products and shares her favorite elements of each. When collaborating with influencers on product reviews, ensure their values align with yours and their followers fit your brand's target audience.</p><h3 id=\"\">4) Vlog-Style Videos</h3><p id=\"\">Many video influencers are industry experts or lifestyle gurus, inspiring fans to solve problems or make buying decisions specific to their niches. Their vlog-style videos sharing daily routines often serve as the most natural ways to incorporate sponsored products.An influencer invites fans \"behind the scenes,\" mentioning a product or a service as part of their daily, weekly, or monthly routines. It fits organically with the content, which makes it effective for driving brand awareness and introducing your product as a solution.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1612px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1612px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be70333851253c33383_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-3.57.08-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Home decor influencer Lucia May Smith regularly redesigns rooms in her home as the seasons change, sharing videos featuring products like Kally Sleep’s bedding.</p><h3 id=\"\">5) Behind-The-Scenes Videos</h3><p id=\"\">Such influencer video campaigns echo vlogging and product placement in some way. An influencer demonstrates the \"behind-the-scenes\" of their activities and casually mentions or showcases a sponsored product in the frame.</p><p id=\"\">The fundamental difference from vlogging here is that these videos are not about lifestyle or morning/daily routines but an influencer's professional background. They may demonstrate the secrets of their job, behind-the-scenes of their niche events, or how they reached certain milestones. The point is to show how your brand helps these individuals reach goals related to their status as a creator.</p><h3 id=\"\">6) How-To and Tutorial Videos</h3><p id=\"\">This type of video collaboration with influencers serves to educate the audience and provide solutions to their problems, which is why viewers resonate with how-to guides and \"life hack\" clips so well.</p><p id=\"\">When working with an influencer on creating a helpful tutorial, make sure to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/a-7-point-guide-to-writing-an-effective-influencer-brief/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">write a compelling brief</a> for them to do everything the best way possible and showcase your product in a favorable and accurate light.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2102px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2102px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be72dde1f8539064548_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-2.01.43-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">A travel influencer on YouTube shares how Skyscanner helps her find affordable flights that support her global lifestyle.</p><p id=\"\">How-to's and life hack videos are super engaging. It's your chance to reach millions of consumers while providing value, and it's your cost-effective way to prompt purchasing decisions.</p><h3 id=\"\">7) Hauls</h3><p id=\"\">Hauls are a kind of unboxing videos, but influencers don't dedicate entire clips to a single product here. They showcase several products within a broader category, like clothing, comparing and mentioning a sponsored product as \"one of\" to fit their video's theme.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2164px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2164px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be8a44e79969403c591_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-2.13.55-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">In this activewear haul, influencer Lottie Lucy showcases her purchases from a variety of brands, including Nike, Adidas, and Puma.</p><p id=\"\">Hauls are about recording how someone goes over a collection of purchases, and that is why they are the most popular among fashion and lifestyle influencers. Your brand has more chances to reach more views if an influencer mentions it in the first half of the video.</p><p id=\"\">Now that you know so many video campaigns to try with influencers for targeting engaged, niche audiences, it's critical to understand the difference between video types and choose creators accordingly. Research the <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/youtube-vs-instagram-vs-tiktok-which-channel-is-best-for-cosmetics-brands/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">video platforms</a> available to you; TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/what-are-instagram-reels/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram Reels</a>, and YouTube Shorts are great for shorter-form videos, but longer videos like product hauls may cater more towards a full YouTube video or IGTV post.</p><p id=\"\">When crafted right, each video campaign on YouTube or any other social media channel can bring outstanding results, exceeding your wildest marketing expectations.</p><p id=\"\">Anastasiia Polokhlyvets is a digital marketing expert at VistaCreate with a background in content, SEO, PR, email, and social media marketing.

In a successful influencer partnership, the brand and influencer receive exposure and buzz. At the same time, each receives validation and social proof from joining forces. When choosing an influencer, brands should select someone that is a natural fit for the brand, which means their content should reflect the brand values prior to the partnership.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-page-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaDgaRI79YE\"><div id=\"\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaDgaRI79YE\" title=\"Why Are Brands Choosing To Work With Influencers? | The Business of Influence | Forbes\"></iframe></div></figure><p id=\"\">Part of why influencers are so successful is their authenticity and genuineness.

Brands should allow influencers to retain their creativity and personal style during partnerships.

Exposure to a branded tweet on Twitter has a <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/influencer-marketing/\" id=\"\">2.7 lift in purchase intent</a>, but when potential customers are exposed to a branded tweet and an influencer’s tweet, that lift is doubled to 5.2.</p><ol start=\"6\" id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Focus on Organic Posts and Content</strong></li></ol><p id=\"\">Today’s consumers know when brands are marketing to them and after being inundated with traditional ads, many consumers are immune to it.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">The world of content creation has rapidly grown in recent years. There are more content professionals than ever before, and most are individual creators. There are over <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/infographic-the-creator-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">50 million content creators</a> in the world, with 2 million of them able to pursue it as a full-time career. Although only 4% of that population reaches six-digit earnings, many of them generate some level of augmented income through their content. Moreover, the rate at which people consume content from individual content creators also continues to rise. Platforms like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram have been on an uptrend for the past decade and show no signs of slowing down.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What is the </strong><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/infographic-the-creator-economy/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong id=\"\">Creator Economy</strong></a><strong id=\"\">?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The creator economy is on the rise, but what is the creator economy to begin with, and who is part of it? The creator economy is simply the overall market of content creation in video, visual, writing, and voice-based content. The creator economy is prevalent mostly on platforms like YouTube and Facebook, where people can earn from views and traffic on top of other additional ways they can cash in on their influence and following. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1930px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1930px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a7a5c85e92e4e916084_image2-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">While “influencers” are more closely associated with growing their following and partnering with brands for monetary gain, the term “creator” includes a broader group of individuals who may produce content just for the art itself, in addition to all types of influencers.Most creators have multiple channels and constantly build on rising platforms as they come up. They earn through sponsored content, advertising, and sales on their own products and on affiliate deals with partner companies.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How the Creator Economy is Affecting Marketers</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The creator economy doesn’t just affect content creators and consumers. It also affects marketers. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer marketing</a> is becoming one of the most effective ways to market online, although there is still room to improve how marketers and companies can accurately measure the ROI on influencer spending. But putting money into third-party content definitely has many perks. It’s much cheaper compared to traditional tri-media and has a more targeted reach (especially when it comes to <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">micro-influencers</a>). It helps build awareness, trust, and convert followers into buyers when the right strategy is put in place. So marketers should definitely be in the loop regarding the creator economy and know which creators to tap within their respective industries.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1300px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1300px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a79af6427b094ac50ad_revel.jpeg\" alt=\"instagram post of nail art on hand\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Instagram user and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencer-outreach-how-to-find-retain-and-empower-micro-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\">micro-influencer</a> Nicole McArthur (@nicmcnailsit) considers herself a self-taught artist rather than a professional, and uses her profile to share nail looks and products like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/revel-nail\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Revel Nail</a>’s polish.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Where the Creator Economy is Going</strong></h2><p id=\"\">To say that the creator economy is huge would be an understatement, but we haven’t seen the peak of the industry yet and might not see it for a while as the digital revolution continues to evolve. Disruptions come up on a daily basis and the landscape is always changing. Here are a few trends that marketers should keep an eye on.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Education and Entertainment Still Rule the Pack</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the biggest creator economy trends for the past few years is an emphasis on education and entertaining content. People like consuming content that allows them to learn or laugh. And so marketers should find creators that not only match their industry and brand values, but also have a certain level of expertise in the field and can provide value to your target audience. When designing a campaign with a creator, try to focus on crafting content that not only promotes your brand but gives educational and entertainment value to people too.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. The Growth of Affiliate Marketing</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Tracking sales from influencer marketing can be tough. Influencer marketing is great for building awareness as it gets eyeballs on a brand, but doesn’t always translate to a lot of sales. One way that companies have tried to incentivize content creators to sell their products is by creating an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-setup-and-run-an-ecommerce-referral-program/\" target=\"_blank\">affiliate marketing program</a>. Many companies start affiliate programs, especially those in the digital product and SaaS market.One solution for influencer discovery and management as well as ambassador marketing strategy is an automated CRM platform like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Pixlee’s influencer marketing solution</a>. When you build out your partnership campaigns over time, it can be helpful to have one software to manage those relationships.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a796a59ec3c00fdba17_kiragrace-influencer.jpeg\" alt=\"woman's instagram post doing yoga pose\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Yogi and influencer @omniyogagirl partners with apparel brand KiraGrace, posing in their gear and offering a unique affiliate discount code to her followers.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Voice-Centric Content is on the Rise</strong></h3><p id=\"\">While video still trumps all forms of content because it can show movement, there has also been a steady increase in voice-centric content as well. Podcast listenership has grown by <a href=\"https://www.convinceandconvert.com/content-marketing/podcast-statistics-charts-and-data/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">29.5% in the last 3 years</a> and will continue to grow. Voice gives people more flexibility to multitask as they consume content. They can drive, exercise, or even work in some cases while also consuming pure audio content. There has also been a rise in voice platforms like Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Twitter Spaces, and Clubhouse to name a few.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Building Trust is Key</strong></h3><p id=\"\">When looking for influencers to work with, marketers should always look first to brands and individuals that have built a level of trust with their audience. There are a lot of vanity numbers in social media, which can often be quite deceiving. Some things that help determine whether a content creator has long term trust with his or her audience is checking whether the creator has received <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-get-verified-social-media-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">verified status on social media</a>, or analyzing their <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-engagement-rate-post-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">engagement rate per post</a>.</p><p id=\"\">Also, look for content creators who have mastered the art of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-user-generated-content-can-reduce-bounce-rate/\" target=\"_blank\">reducing bounce rates</a> and focus on quality listens and views and have longer watch times than most. These criteria help marketers determine whether they’re really getting engagement on influencer contracts and not just shallow visibility.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Monetizing Strategies are Varied</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Content creators are making money in various ways now. We already discussed sponsorships and affiliate marketing, but there are other ways too such as <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/ecommerce-during-uncertain-times-how-brands-are-delivering-on-promises-to-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">making money through e-commerce</a>, dropshipping, and direct advertising. Some creators prefer to earn by sharing their expert knowledge and make money by selling <a href=\"https://www.ispringsolutions.com/blog/how-to-create-online-course\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">online courses</a>. The creator economy market map is also quickly expanding as influencers and content creators start tapping into more niche markets. For instance, there are some creators that might focus on entry-level gadgets while others might focus on higher-tier products. The gamers’ community also is another great example as some might reach a bigger reach with popular games like PUBG and Mobile Legends, and some might narrow their focus down by talking about novelty games on old-school consoles. Spend time researching <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencer-marketing-a-guide-to-getting-better-engagement/#:~:text=Who%20is%20a%20Micro%2DInfluencer,are%20experts%20in%20their%20field.\" target=\"_blank\">what scale of influencer</a> is right for your brand.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">6. The Future Looks Bright</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In 2019, over <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/infographic-the-creator-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">a third of children</a> aspired to be YouTubers when they start working. Some are starting that journey early as there has also been a rise in online child influencers and stars. What that tells us is that the future of the creator economy looks bright as we will still see an uptick in content creators.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1936px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1936px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a7aa4b506d4422402fd_image4-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Content <a href=\"https://www.guide2research.com/research/communications-degree\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">creators with a communications degree</a> have shown to have a lot of success in their field, so it's still one of the most desired college courses for people looking to become professional bloggers, vloggers, or influencers. </p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">7. Digital Content Will Continue to Rise</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The creator economy growth is obviously still on an uptrend. This is because there is an increase not just in the supply of content, but also in the available platforms to publish content and the available audience. People are spending more and more time on the internet, and the market will continue to rise as that shift continues to happen. So it’s not too late for marketers who aren’t leveraging on influencer marketing yet to get into the game. Influencers will be here for quite a while and they will continue to provide results and value to brands.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing in a Content-Driven World</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Content is quickly becoming the new currency as individual creators continue trumping the attention-grabbing game. Brands should focus on three main areas when it comes to content marketing: <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-never-fail-tips-for-crafting-compelling-branded-content/\" target=\"_blank\">branded content</a> (created in-house), and influencer or ambassador partnerships. With these three tools in your marketing arsenal, expect to see your brand influence grow.</p>",

With more and more brands and businesses relying on influencers to help them create buzz on social media and beyond around products, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. This leads many brands and marketers to fall into an overspending trap, aiming to partner with major influencers or pay influencer discovery services that don’t deliver efficiently.</p><p id=\"\">The thing is, throwing money at high-dollar influencer marketing doesn't provide an automatic customer base. If you're on a small-medium-sized business budget, the last thing you want is to spend an incredible amount of money with very little return.</p><p id=\"\">An effective influencer marketing campaign can be both cheap and expensive. It all depends on how you allocate the budget, and the tools you rely on to determine your best potential collaborations. We'll break down best practices in which a budget can be stretched in order to give your influencer marketing strategy a much-needed boost.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Much Should You Spend on Influencer Marketing Strategy?</h2><p id=\"\">Let's brush up on some influencer marketing statistics before we get started. This way, you know whether you're spending too much or too little. That said, when we talk about the exact number, there is no simple, one-line answer. It all depends on the brand, product, and influencer.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But, the general rule of thumb from <a href=\"https://www.linqia.com/insights/how-much-budget-should-you-spend-on-influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">a research paper</a> by Altimeter Research said brands should expect to spend 20-25% of their digital budgets on influencer marketing, as many companies spend roughly about 5-15% of turnover on marketing. That ballpark is worth considering, especially if you heavily rely on social channels for your overall marketing campaign and have serious intent to boost awareness on those platforms.</p><p id=\"\">Regarding how much you should pay individual influencers, for long-term campaigns or one-off posts, take a look at follower count <em id=\"\">as well as </em>creativity, talent, and engagement rate. Our <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-ultimate-influencer-pay-guide-for-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer pay guide</a> dives into the details on each of these elements.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Stretch Your Influencer Marketing Budget</h2><p id=\"\">The challenge is finding cost-effective ways to get your name out without going over your allotted budget. In order to make your dollar go further without sacrificing the quality of your partnership and its resulting topic, there are a few specific practices you should follow.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Set Clear Goals and Metrics</h3><p id=\"\">This may seem like a no-brainer, but influencer and social media marketing is a relatively new and ever-changing industry. With new social features and creators emerging every day, it can be easy to lose sight of your goals. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a newbie marketer, goals and preferable metrics are the starting point of an effective influencer campaign.</p><p id=\"\">Before you spend any money on the budget, make sure you clearly understand what you expect from the influencer marketing strategy you’re about to invest in. Do you want more website traffic? <a href=\"https://brand24.com/blog/8-marketing-tactics-to-build-brand-awareness/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Brand awareness</a>? Sales leads?

Make sure you also tie these metrics to your overall brand success and revenue as best you can. This is where influencer marketing platforms come in handy; by using technology to map influencer-powered results to business success, you’ll have an easier time determining what partnerships and strategies are most profitable.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69db6e517df9f5b401f99_image5%20(13).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"screenshot of Pixlee TurnTo influencer profile platform\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Pixlee TurnTo’s <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing solution</a> can help your team track influencer-specific metrics alongside campaign analytics to find the best influencers for your business and tie your overall influencer strategy to the bottom line.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Structure Deals that Maximize Content Value</h3><p id=\"\">This one is important and will save you loads of money in the long run. Remember, it's not just about working with influencers who have a high follower count; sometimes a smaller-scale influencer may have more sway over your specific target audience because they have a closer relationship with those individuals.</p><p id=\"\">You want to focus on agreements that guarantee the most value for your money in regard to the content being produced and your overall objectives as a brand. Here are some reasons why people erode their trust in an influencer based on the content they produced:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1101px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1101px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69dd3e6277ec1dd0fc8f2_image7%20(6).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Graph of &quot;What erodes your trust in an influencer?&quot;\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/public-relations/do-consumers-trust-social-media-influencers-overcoming-barriers-to-im-success/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">One way to do this is by requesting certain types of content from influencers, like stories, photos with captions, or videos. By having influencers produce specific types of content, you're able to control the overall narrative while still getting a creative spin from the people you trust. Develop a campaign brief (within your influencer marketing platform) that clearly outlines the message and content types your company is interested in, and work as a team with your influencer(s) to design content that truly resonates with their audience.</p><p id=\"\">This also allows you to use that content across multiple channels and gives you more bang for your buck.

In fact, they might be more beneficial to your campaign than the A-listers.</p><p id=\"\">Micro-influencers are an underrated <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/types-of-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">type of influencer</a> that generally have a smaller but more engaged following, which can be extremely valuable to your brand. They also tend to be more affordable and willing to try new things and more likely to hustle to grow their fan base. No wonder why 90% of businesses want to work with them.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1518px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1518px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69ddf1f952bfce605bbc1_image4%20(11).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Graph showing what types of influencers brands want to work with\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.meltwater.com/en/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Plus, micro-influencers are often viewed as more relatable and trustworthy by their followers-- which is why micro-influencers boast an average engagement rate of <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">3.86%</a>, while mega-influencers see only 1.21%.</p><p id=\"\">The ideal way to start finding micro-influencers is by looking in your existing customer base. Community members who are already talking about your products or industry in general are more likely to want to work with you. In our <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/guides/the-2022-influencer-trend-report\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">2022 Influencer Trend Report</a>, the majority of influencers said “personal interest in the brand” was the most important factor when considering a partnership.</p><p id=\"\">Brands like Alo Yoga work with influencers and brand ambassadors to create unique campaigns across social media, the brand’s website, email, and more.</p><p id=\"\">Start by checking out the <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) already being shared by your fans on social media. Pixlee TurnTo allows brands to identify top advocates and individual pieces of UGC, and then onboard select creators to your influencer marketing program.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Collaborate with Other Brands&nbsp;</h3><p id=\"\">One way to get more from your influencer marketing budget is by teaming up with other brands in your industry. This can be done by partnering with a complementary brand on an influencer campaign or cross-promoting content across channels.</p><p id=\"\">For example, if you have a skincare line and want to collaborate with an indie makeup brand. You can team up and send each other products to use in tutorials, blog posts, or social media posts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://breadnbeyond.com/artificial-intelligence/content-marketing-tools/\">AI-powered content marketing tools</a> can also help you come up with ideas for collaborative posts.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69decc97cb42de17bc694_image1%20(15).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Screenshot of influencer @ellbird's Instagram post tagging multiple brands\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Influencers are often receptive to working with multiple brands at once, especially if they compliment each other.</p><p id=\"\">Not only will this give you access to a whole new group of followers, but it's a great way to build relationships with other industry leaders.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Work With UGC Creators</h3><p id=\"\">When it comes to cost-effective marketing, user-generated content is king. When you want both to come up with new content instantly and generate trust while still playing a role in the campaign process, you can rely on UGC Creators.</p><p id=\"\">UGC Creators differ from traditional influencers and brand ambassadors as they’re primarily building content for brands to share on their own channels, rather than the creators’ channels. It’s the perfect marriage of the creator economy and UGC, and it’s less expensive to produce than in-house content.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69df6096728655012257f_image6%20(9).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">This is a great way to emanate the organic feeling of UGC while also building relationships within the influencer community. UGC Creators can often be found alongside influencers in creator networks like Pixlee TurnTo’s.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Publish Influencer Content Across Multiple Channels</h3><p id=\"\">Just because you're working with influencers doesn't mean you should put all your eggs in one basket. In fact, the most successful marketing campaigns are those that use a variety of channels to reach their target audiences. This can translate into measurable results, especially when you include an element of social commerce in your influencer campaigns (think: influencer posts shared on your brand’s website, tagged with featured products).</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69e07e6277e2bac0fcf32_image3%20(14).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of shoppable influencer content on Alo Yoga website\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Influencer marketing can be paired with many marketing channels, such as email marketing, social media advertising, and content marketing, to maximize reach and engagement. For example, if you're <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-boost-your-product-launch-with-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">launching a new product</a>, you can use influencer marketing to create buzz around it, but also use paid ads and email marketing to drive sales.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This multi-channel approach will not only help you reach more people but will also increase your chances of converting leads into customers.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Measure and Analyze Results</h3><p id=\"\">The campaign doesn't stop when the influencer posts go live. In order to determine whether your campaign was successful, you need to measure and analyze the results against the initial goals you outlined before the campaign began. This includes looking at things like website traffic, social media engagement, and sales.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">By taking the time to measure and analyze the results of your campaign, you can make adjustments as needed to improve its effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f69e16e6277e04290fcfae_image2%20(16).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Pixlee TurnTo's influencer offering\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></a></figure><p id=\"\">Choosing the platform that makes it much easier for you to track your budget-friendly influencer marketing campaign is key here.

Managing expectations and maintaining satisfaction for two or more parties can be difficult. However, with good management and help from a few tools, any influencer marketing manager can succeed.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we’re going to list seven essential tools for influencer marketing managers to have in your arsenal and make your next partnership a success. Read on below to find out which tools you need to invest in for your next influencer marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Pixlee TurnTo: <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Influencer Marketing Platform</a></h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1140px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1140px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd314f8cfc5b3c9ad6507_image6%20(5).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Pixlee TurnTo platforms showing two i\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">An influencer marketing platform can help you discover new influencers in your niche, manage creators, partnerships, and content from start to finish, and analyze campaign success based on ecommerce metrics tied to sales.</p><p id=\"\">With Pixlee TurnTo, everything from content collection to messaging is integrated into one platform so you don’t need to move from one platform to another. You can also extend Pixlee TurnTo’s services to manage <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) and discover potential brand advocates within your existing community. Pixlee TurnTo also has various features that can help you elevate your influencer marketing strategies and stand out from your competitors, like influencer link tracking tools and the ability to map specific influencers and content pieces to revenue in dollar amounts.</p><p id=\"\">Whether you’re a bigger brand working with a lot of influencers of various sizes, or a smaller brand working with just a few for the time being, spreadsheets don’t cut it when it comes to influencer marketing. There are a lot of factors that need to be considered and visible to your team, so investing in a versatile management platform can pay off, big time.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Notion: Online Planner</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1920px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1920px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd32d643b735188b5be5a_image4%20(7).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Notion Roadmap feature showing different tasks on a calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/help/guides/timeline-view-unlocks-high-output-planning-for-your-team\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">The key to a successful <a href=\"https://milkwhale.com/influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer campaign</a> is having a solid plan outlined for your team and for yourself. A tool we recommend for personal planning is Notion, which is popular for being a multi-purpose platform. Notion can be used for a variety of things such as website creation, project management, and even journaling. However, they’re excellent for planning time-sensitive tasks.</p><p id=\"\">When it comes to influencer marketing, time management is highly important. Handling influencers and content means that there are deadlines to meet. With a tool such as Notion, you can stay on track and ensure that everything is going according to plan. You can also utilize the tool’s “Timeline View” feature to oversee a project’s timeline.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Notion has <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">four pricing plans</a> to choose from depending on the scale of your influencer marketing operations. The good news is that Notion’s personal plan is free, so if you want to get a feel for the platform by planning just your own tasks, you don’t have to pay from the get-go.</p><h1 id=\"\">3. Emplifi: Social Media Management</h1><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1000px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1000px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd3536c2c2be3265945c9_image3%20(7).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Emplifi d\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/social-media-analytics-the-complete-guide\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">As an influencer marketing manager, it’s likely that you play a role in the social content shared on your brand’s profiles, from Instagram to TikTok. <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/products/social-media-marketing/community\" id=\"\">Emplifi’s social media marketing</a> solution lets you create and schedule custom social content to a variety of different platforms, and monitor success metrics as defined by your team. This is especially useful if you’re resharing influencer content as your own posts.</p><p id=\"\">Like Pixlee TurnTo, Emplifi also offers community management, analytics, and social listening tools to help you continue tweaking your influencer marketing campaigns to be the best they can be.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Google Drive: Cloud Storage</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1458px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1458px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd38d92a2d9dad393089e_image1%20(8).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of sample \" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/id/drive/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">When managing influencers and their content, you’re going to need a vast amount of storage. Printing out content might not be feasible and resorting to a hard drive might be challenging to do so especially if you work in a team. So, the best way to share content and files with your team and influencers is by using cloud storage.</p><p id=\"\">Cloud storage is great because anyone who has access to it can open it from practically anywhere. This makes remote work easier and you won’t have to worry about forgetting any files since you can upload anything within minutes. This will also make working with clients and influencers much easier.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">We recommend using Google Drive because it’s free and it’s perfect for collaborative work. Sharing access can be made easy by using links or emails. Users can also comment on images and edit folders.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Wise: Payment System</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd40bed2869fc837444c1_image2%20(8).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://wise.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">The third thing you need as an influencer marketing manager is a proper payment system. Whether you’re paying influencers commissions or flat rates, it’s important that you pay them on time and efficiently. Making single payments can be inefficient and time-consuming. With a payment system like <a href=\"https://wise.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Wise</a>, you can send payments electronically and automatically.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">If you’re working with smaller-scale creators or brand ambassadors, Pixlee TurnTo’s product-for-post capability allows you to easily send these individuals free products in exchange for posts on their social media profiles. Consider the different ways your brand can pay influencers; check out our <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-ultimate-influencer-pay-guide-for-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer pay guide</a> for more.</p><p id=\"\">To ensure that payments are made on time and seamlessly, it’s important to settle on a payment platform or system that works for you. You will also be using this platform to receive transactions from clients as well. There are a lot of platforms out there you can choose from. Before settling on a payment platform, do your research and look for references.</p><p id=\"\">Wise is especially useful if you have clients or influencers overseas. Another platform that’s popular is Paypal, and some creators build subscription models in <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Patreon</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Stellar: Review Seeding Program</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638fd3fff8cfc5ae50ae1513_image5%20(8).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Stellar's home page\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">One of the most effective influencer marketing strategies is product reviews. Influencer marketing managers get product reviews by sending products to creators. Pixlee TurnTo offers Creator Reviews, automatically asking the influencers you work with to share a review of your product after they use it as part of a campaign.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Taking reviews a step further, <a href=\"https://stellarreviews.com/\" id=\"\">Stellar</a> offers review seeding programs that integrate with influencer management platforms like Pixlee TurnTo. With Pixlee TurnTo and Stellar’s seamless integration, food and beverage container brand <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/stanley\" id=\"\">Stanley</a> is able to run these sampling campaigns and launch reviews live on-site in under four weeks.

Canva’s regular plan is free and offers access to thousands of templates, graphics and tools, while the pro (paid) plan offers even more and the ability to add team members to your account.</p><p id=\"\">Canva can be valuable for influencer marketing managers who need to design quick assets, from social media posts calling for new influencers to reach out to sample content that influencers can work off of when designing their own promotional posts. In fact, Canva can be used to design anything for your brand — use the pro plan’s “brand kit” tool to upload logos and colors, and build everything from campaign briefs to business cards to slide decks.</p><p id=\"\">Influencer marketing management is a challenging job. It’s a fast-paced working environment with lots of things to keep up with. It requires good management skills and the ability to maintain relationships with both clients and influencers. With so many demands, it can be hard to do without any tools.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The <a href=\"https://monday.com/blog/project-management/guide-to-project-management/\" target=\"_blank\">importance of project management</a> can't be underestimated. To succeed in influencer marketing management, influencer marketing managers need to invest in certain tools to maintain their business.

As a consumer, step into a store and you’re transported into a world full of branded displays, service, and face-to-face interaction with products of interest. Go to a store’s website and (for those brands with a developed understanding of the former) consumers can come to expect much of that same experience translated into a digital format.</p><p id=\"\">The experience that an in-store experience provides is only matched by the convenience of an online experience. The brands that are most successful at building a quality retail strategy are the ones that have a consistent brand across both digital and brick-and mortar. Whether you’re a physical retailer looking to virtualize your shopping experience or an ecommerce brand hoping to open your flagship store, consider how the two avenues work in tandem together rather than at odds. Consider these 7 tips to improving the online shopping experience.</p><ol id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Invest in Website Appearance and Functionality</li></ol><p id=\"\">First impressions matter. No one wants to arrive at a terrible looking website. And more importantly, with the plethora of competitors across industries at a consumer’s disposal, no one has <em id=\"\">time</em> to browse a terrible looking website.</p><p id=\"\">As an online brand, your website <em id=\"\">is</em> your first impression. While the shopper may find you through a variety of different channels, once they arrive, it’s about convincing them to linger through the “racks,” rather than to pass by the window. An underdeveloped mash of pages with unappealing color combinations, poor navigation, and abundance of Comic Sans font is probably not going to encourage potential customers to browse.</p><p id=\"\">In order to avoid a bad first impression, start by investing in the look and feel of your brand as a whole—the logo, color scheme, taglines, and voice. Emphasize the appeal of the homepage with a proper balance of visuals and educational context for whatever your target audience may be. The person browsing may not be in the purchase stage of the customer journey—but rather still in the awareness and consideration stage.

Depending on your industry, consider including real customer photos, tutorials, recipes, and more.</p><ol start=\"2\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Focus on Mobile Responsiveness </li></ol><p id=\"\">With a smartphone in hand, the days of shopping via desktop are being quickly replaced by mobile scrolling. Mobile sales alone for <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/webinar/the-biggest-winners-of-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2016\" id=\"\">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> 2016 topped $1 billion! This trend proves that mobile is here to stay. It’s time that all retailers build our their shopping experience on mobile. Greater access to Internet connections and data packages makes this possible but—as we’ve already learned—not all websites are created equal.</p><p id=\"\">Browsing a website with poor mobile responsiveness can prove incredibly frustrating for consumers and easily lead to cart abandonment. Make sure your business’ website is functional across as many devices as possible, and consider how layouts of all content types will transfer onto smaller screens. For example, a photo of quality size and resolution on desktop may prove less effective when opened in mobile browsing. Be conscious of the devices that customers are operating on so that the experience remains streamlined across the board.<br> </p><ol start=\"3\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Be Mindful of Website Speed</li></ol><p id=\"\">A beautiful website that takes ten or more seconds to load is most likely a beautiful website few customers will actually stick around to appreciate. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-websites-perceived-load-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Time is money</a>, possibly more so online, than it is in person. As a general rule of thumb, aim to keep website load time at <a href=\"https://cloudinary.com/blog/media_related_web_development_challenges\">three seconds or less</a>, to ensure visitors won’t grow impatient and close that window. According to the founder of Just Add Content, Gabriel A. Mays, the “biggest threat [to a business’ website] isn’t a competitor, it’s the back button.”</p><p id=\"\">When incorporating third party applications or displays onto your site, make sure that they do not slow your site down. Their added benefit may not outweigh their added cost if your load time increases.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg\" alt=\"\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><ol start=\"4\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Embrace Customer Photos</li></ol><p id=\"\">Giving customer an idea of what a product looks and feels like without being able to actually see and hold it can prove quite challenging online. However, there is one easy solution to replicating this in-store experience online. Customers can get a more authentic idea of what a product is really like by seeing how other real customers are using it. That’s why displaying real customer photos on your ecommerce site is proven to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/download/the-use-cases-of-user-generated-content\" id=\"\">increase sales 2X</a>. This is why strategies built out around <a href=\"https://blog.pixlee.com/how-social-media-influencers-make-or-break-your-business\" id=\"\">social influencers</a> have become so commonplace. Social media influencers are a great way to encourage customers to get posting about your brand on social media. Let your customers open the door for new ones, and utilize their own photos to help build out content across your business’ website.</p><ol start=\"5\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Consider Live Chat</li></ol><p id=\"\">The need for service is just as alive online as it is in-store and one of the best things you can provide to customers purchasing online is real-time support. <a href=\"https://getvoip.com/live-chat-software/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Live chat functionality</a> assures that customers receive answers to any questions or concerns they might have. Give them outlets to ask questions and find answers when they want—just make sure the ends of those outlets are always stocked with an actual individual, or the most accurate information for that given time. Good online support can help to smooth over a customer’s bad ecommerce experience.</p><ol start=\"6\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Befriend FREE Shipping</li></ol><p id=\"\">A deciding factor exclusive to online shopping is the cost to deliver. As a business, you have to be conscious of price points that generate profit, but free and discounted shopping options can certainly increase the bottom line. A promo like Amazon’s, for example, which offers free shipping on purchases that total $25 or more, sets the bar for what a customer must spend in order to “save”. Think of it from a customer’s perspective: would you rather get free shipping buy more and receive more items<em id=\"\">,</em> or would you rather pay for shipping decide against that extra sweater and receive less items? For consumers, the choice is more often than not crystal clear.<br> </p><ol start=\"7\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Turn Social Proof Into Trust</li></ol><p id=\"\">Allow online shoppers to engage with your ecommerce site and visualize how to incorporate your products into their everyday lives with the power of social proof. What is social proof? These are the visual and text reviews that customers leave endorsing your products. Platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook have given brands the ability to collet real visual stories from customers about their products and visual marketing software such as Pixlee allows marketers to display this user generated content on their brand sites.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Social media is no longer just for individuals to stay connected with friends across borders; brands use it to promote and launch their products, influencers use it to share content and build communities of loyal followers, and general users use it to shop, stay entertained, and learn about the world around them.</p><p>Social media is a massive piece of marketing today because of the diverse <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) that’s shared across these platforms each day. Smartphones today give anyone the opportunity to be a creator, meaning brands have access to a wealth of authentic, community-driven UGC that can be used to add <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/is-social-proof-marketing-the-next-big-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">social proof</a> to marketing campaigns.</p><h2>Sharing UGC Today</h2><p>Since <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">​​84% of consumers</a> say they trust peer recommendations above all other sources of advertising, it’s no wonder that 87% of brands use UGC for authentic (and free) content. However, the growth of digital marketing in the last decade lends itself to UGC thriving outside of social media platforms as well.<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">‍</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">Pixlee’s CRM platform</a> automatically pulls in customer content from a brand team’s channels of choice, and allows brands to publish this UGC far and wide while tracking success metrics. From email marketing to in-store displays, there’s no shortage of creative places your brand can use UGC.</p><h2>8 Innovative Ways to Reuse UGC</h2><h3>1. Community Newsletters</h3><p>UGC in emails is essential for brands looking to incorporate their communities better. Customer photos, videos, and reviews center your marketing around people rather than products — while putting those products in context and inspiring your email recipients to think about how they could incorporate your brand into their daily lives.</p><p>By focusing your newsletters on community, you’re likely to promote more UGC from your fans and find additional advocates for your brand. Create personalized newsletters for your fans filled with photos by people like them, and you’ll see how <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-pixlee-improves-your-email-performance-with-user-generated-content/\" target=\"_blank\">UGC can improve your email performance</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1886px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1886px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad73ede1d87d4532988_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.41.29-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Carnival Cruises inspires future vacationers to plan their next trip by sharing vacation stories through customer UGC in its email newsletters.</p><h3>2. Live Displays/Billboards</h3><p>Digital billboards and displays can be more creative and more targeted when brands use authentic UGC to populate their content. This improves brand awareness by exposing a new audience to your brand community and social proof marketing efforts.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:480px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"480px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad80333852934c32f93_image10.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Brookfield Properties featured Pixlee-powered UGC at its various in-person shopping and dining establishments, inspiring visitors to share their own photos.</p><p>Showing user-generated content on digital billboards also lets your team monitor, track, modify, manage, and display content at your leisure, in real-time, and at your discretion.</p><h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/lookbooks-and-inspiration-galleries\" target=\"_blank\">Inspiration Galleries</a></h3><p>Community-driven brands are loud and proud about showcasing their valued community members, and your brand’s website is the perfect place to do that while also inspiring site visitors to envision themselves owning your product.</p><p>Inspiration galleries give visitors an avenue for visual product discovery and a clear path to purchase, as they’re already on your website. Pixlee’s Shoppable Gallery Badges allow site visitors to shop directly from customer UGC for products featured in each piece of content. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2422px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2422px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad73d762f23a90b1a9d_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.43.16-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>With Pixlee, brands can create live inspiration galleries on any site page; Navy Hair Care has 16 galleries live site-wide, and saw a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/navy-hair-care\" target=\"_blank\">264% increase in repeat-visit rate</a> after implementing this UGC.</p><h3>4. Product Pages</h3><p>Contextualizing products is crucial to improving user experience and boosting purchase confidence for online shoppers. Customers are more hesitant to buy items based solely on a brand’s product photos, which are sometimes misleading. Seeing products in action from real customer photos removes any lingering doubts about an item’s quality or effectiveness. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2182px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2182px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad7a44e79f96803b929_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.45.05-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>This is why showcasing UGC on your product pages is a great move. Think about the times you’ve scrolled through the reviews on a product just to see what it actually looks like in real life? Give your customers an easy way to find that contextualization.</p><h3>5. Email Unsubscribe Page or 404 Pages</h3><p>Get creative with where you’re sharing UGC on-site beyond product pages! This could include putting a carousel of UGC on your 404 pages to draw site visitors back into your live site, or even showcasing your community on your email unsubscribe page. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2370px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2370px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad7ef1d711d818ce446_hylete-email-unsubscribe-page-ugc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>HYLETE’s email unsubscribe page features an endearing carousel of Pixlee-powered UGC, catching customers at an often overlooked stage of the email marketing journey.</p><h3>6. Order Confirmation “Thank You” Page</h3><p>Just because a shopper has already purchased from your brand doesn’t mean you’re all out of opportunities for UGC marketing. Share community content on the “Thank You” page directly after a customer makes a purchase.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1538px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1538px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad760519a912b98bb64_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.46.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>UGC shows consumers how real people interact with a product (even a highly-priced one), adding a sense of comfort to customers when they purchase that item. Extend this to the post-purchase experience and you leave your buyer feeling confident in their purchase and connected to your brand.</p><h3>7. Order Tracking Page</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/dont-forget-the-post-purchase-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">post-purchase experience</a> doesn’t end with the order confirmation; when customers visit your site to track their purchases, you can use this as another opportunity to deepen your relationship by showcasing visual UGC from your community. Each touchpoint in the online shopping experience has an impact on how customers perceive your brand, so take advantage of every time they return to your site.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1522px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1522px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad8e6eb015019d6fe14_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.47.32-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Annie Selke’s order tracking page is loaded with CTAs and a gallery of customer content to inspire recent shoppers looking forward to receiving their products.</p><h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/ugc-social-distancing-bringing-the-in-store-experience-online/\" target=\"_blank\">In-Store Displays</a></h3><p>As we’ve shown, UGC can be a valuable tool to convert shoppers by letting them see how other consumers like them interact with your brand and product. One way to incorporate this element into your brand’s in-person shopping experience is by utilizing digital signage. Through this approach, you’re able to maintain the quality of your UGC (even videos) while making it accessible to those who aren’t shopping online.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1506px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1506px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad8f675e8c8f6e5ffc1_Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-1.48.55-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Puma’s use of Pixlee-powered UGC on interactive in-store screens lets shoppers browse UGC photos and videos while they're shopping in person, providing an added level of social proof.</p><p>Social media is essential to a well-rounded approach to community-driven brand marketing and serves as a platform for inspirational customer content your brand team might not have even thought of. However, this doesn’t mean UGC needs to stay there; its full potential for conversion, increased brand awareness, and community-building is unlocked when it’s used across your marketing channels.</p>",

Although wildly popular among brands on social media at the moment, it’s still a relatively new concept and comes with several benefits ecommerce marketers should be aware of. </p><h2 id=\"\">What is Shoppable Content? </h2><p id=\"\">If you have used Instagram before, you’ve probably noticed images with clickable links directly on the post; that’s shoppable content. Let’s say you like a specific product in that image. Because it’s made shoppable on the app, clicking the link on the post directs you to the product page, and you can purchase that product. Today, apps like Instagram have made it so shoppers don’t even have to leave the Instagram app to peruse products and check out. Here is an excellent example of how athletic apparel brand Alo Yoga shares shoppable content on Instagram: </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2362px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2362px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2be32dde1fc16a06452f_Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.23.31-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Because any content can be made shoppable with product tagging, leading brands in community-driven marketing (like Alo) often share shoppable UGC from the brand’s own customers.</p><h2 id=\"\">Beyond Social: The Deeper Value of Shoppable Video Content</h2><p id=\"\">Shoppable videos are valuable content to help customers contextualize products by viewing them in-action while letting them purchase with ease. While shoppable video content is primarily used as an asset by brands on social media, it’s far beyond a social phenomenon. Innovative brands utilize shoppable videos in other areas of their marketing, such as on-site galleries or product pages.</p><p id=\"\">For the brand’s first <a href=\"https://us.puma.com/us/en/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">TikTok Fashion Show</a>, Puma partnered with several well-known creators, challenging them to incorporate specific Puma graphics into their own unique designs.

With over 1.3 billion active users, Instagram is the fourth most popular social media site, just after Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp. What’s more, a rough estimation of advertising revenue from Instagram in the US was nearly $10 billion in 2019, according to research by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Statista</a>.

Brands can make their Instagram videos shoppable by adding product tags or shopping stickers in the content — on Reels, Stories, or create standalone shoppable videos.</p><p id=\"\">You can tag products on Instagram Reels by adding a \"view products\" link that directs customers to your product page, where customers can purchase it directly or continue shopping for other items.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Digital business has given birth to digital marketing, and web owners are constantly trying to reach customers through marketing tactics that speak to this digital age. The digital world is moving at a fast pace, and clinging to traditional strategies may be a marketer’s downfall to competitors. Being a digital marketer, you need to be more innovative and keep up with trends to consistently monitor your strategies. Here’s where brand ambassadors come into the picture.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Who is a Brand Ambassador?</strong></h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.tapinfluence.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">71% of marketers</a> believe that ongoing ambassadorships are the most effective form of influencer marketing. So what exactly is an ambassadorship? A brand ambassador is a person appointed by a company or an organization to showcase the positiveness of the brand and its products. A form of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a>, ambassadors also play a pivotal role in increasing brand awareness and sales.A brand ambassador can be a single person or a group of people. This can range from company employees to existing customers sharing positive reviews of your brand on social media.</p><p id=\"\">These influencers also use other communication tools like emails, messages, and word of mouth publicity (which generates more than <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">twice the sales</a> of paid advertising) to generate engagement from their fans. Unlike general influencers, brand ambassadors are generally loyal to a specific brand, consistently promoting its products often through a paid partnership that provides them with free products, discounts, or monetary compensation. </p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Types of Brand Ambassadors:</strong></h3><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Employee Ambassador</strong> – an existing employee who also doubles as a brand advocate.</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Existing Customers</strong> – who willingly post <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) showcasing their experience with the brand’s product on social media, and share their unsolicited enthusiasm for your brand through word of mouth</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Event Ambassador</strong> – individuals representing and marketing your products at various events or solely for specific campaigns</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Strong Audience Ambassador</strong> – social users with a loyal target audience and is a trusted identity (like <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">micro influencers</a>, who tend to have niche, engaged followings)</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Field Authority Experts</strong> – experts in their respective fields and serve as ambassadors, like a professional Yogi promoting <a href=\"https://pixlee.com/case-studies/alo-yoga\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Alo Yoga</a> gear</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Student Ambassador</strong> – typically young adults, students who can successfully promote the target audience on a college or related campusLong story short, these individuals typically fall into two broader groups: established influencers and smaller-scale fans. Selecting who to target as a brand influencer involves identifying who is most connected with your target audience and aligns with your brand’s values. </p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why Ambassador Marketing?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Why invest in an ambassador program? Apart from generic search engine optimization (SEO) and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-never-fail-tips-for-crafting-compelling-branded-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">branded content</a>, your brand needs a personal touch to establish itself amongst the competitors. Many think of ambassadors as the midpoint between micro influencers and customers.</p><p id=\"\">Ambassador marketing is already a winning strategy because your brand connects with influencers, fans, and customers already supporting your products – often on social media or other high-visibility channels. Since <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">74% of consumers</a> rely on social media to inform their purchasing decisions, it’s a good bet to focus your ambassador program efforts there first; if that’s where your customers already are. This bond translates to future success and customer loyalty; the lifetime value for customers referred by brand ambassadors is <a href=\"https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Schmitt_Skiera_VandenBulte_2013_Referrral_Programs_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">16% higher</a> than other customers.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Start an Ambassador Program</strong></h2><p id=\"\">When a brand offers several individuals the opportunity to join a structured, ongoing partnership to promote products, this is called a brand ambassador program.</p><p id=\"\">Hiring students to use their online influence to create awareness about your brand and its products is often termed a <strong id=\"\">college brand ambassador</strong> program. College brand ambassadors can host campus-centric campaigns or events and also use word-of-mouth publicity through posters, social profiles, and online groups available to other students to increase your brand’s visibility.</p><p id=\"\">Partnership with individual bloggers or influencers who work as affiliate marketers is known as <strong id=\"\">affiliate brand ambassadors</strong>. They often get a commission on customer purchases that result from their marketing efforts, or personalized discount codes and free products. Both the company and the ambassador gain through this ambassador program.</p><p id=\"\">Known for its top-tier car racks and other outdoor gear, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/building-a-powerful-brand-ambassador-program-featuring-sylvia-choi-of-yakima/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Yakima Racks</a> created its ambassador program, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/building-a-powerful-brand-ambassador-program-featuring-sylvia-choi-of-yakima/\" id=\"\">the RackPack</a>, as an extension of its brand through relationships with individuals whose lifestyles align with the brand’s products.

They are usually gifted with free products from the brand or hired on a commission basis.</p><p id=\"\">These ambassadors tend to have a strong following on social media, resulting in increased ROI and brand awareness.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Designing a Best-in-Class Ambassador Program</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Once you have decided which ambassador program is right for you, you must choose what motivation you will provide to your incoming advocates. A few examples include monetary compensation, commission, discounts, and free samples or products to feature in posts. You can also grant VIP access to events or new products to incentivize your ambassadors.</p><p id=\"\">Now it’s time to pinpoint the individuals you want to reach out to. Start by searching through your brand mentions, existing followers, and related hashtags on social media. You can also use Pixlee’s platform for this step in influencer discovery; social users will be suggested to you based on your brand’s products and goals. Identify users with more followers than the typical social account whose interests and lifestyle align with your brand, and reach out to them with your offer via DM or email. A few factors you should consider when choosing ambassadors:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Are their posts professional and appropriate to reflect your brand values?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are they already using your products?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are their posts relevant to your products?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do they have high levels of engagement with their followers?</li></ul><p id=\"\">Beyond these initial points, make sure to scout their social media profiles for authenticity, leadership, and high-quality content. Just because someone’s lifestyle is perfect for promoting your products doesn’t mean they will actually produce good, professional-level content.</p><p id=\"\">Once your ambassadors start sharing content, it’s your marketing team’s job to amplify their posts and engage with them publicly. This shows authenticity in your relationship with these individuals.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Measuring Progress</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The ultimate step of any marketing program is always the results. After ensuring that your tracking methods and analytical tools are perfect, measure the progress of your ambassador program. On average, businesses make <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">$6.50 for every dollar</a> invested in influencer marketing, so use that as a reference point.</p><p id=\"\">Check all the possible factors, like the link clicks, engagement rate, impressions and reach, conversions, and inbound traffic. This makes it easier to identify which ambassadors are contributing to the success of your digital business, and which relationships to pour the most resources into.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Authentic Community Growth with Ambassadors</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Brand ambassadors are experts at bringing your products into the social media limelight and gaining customer trust. A well-crafted brand ambassador program helps in building audience loyalty to your company and increasing ROI.</p><p id=\"\">The passion with which a brand ambassador works is commendable, so it’s wise to empower these people and provide them with quality support and resources.</p><p id=\"\">Reward these ambassadors handsomely as they are a valuable part of your brand’s journey.</p><p id=\"\">‍<em id=\"\">Being a Digital Marketing Executive at </em><a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">CheapSSLShop</em></a><em id=\"\">, Gunjan Tripathi has an in-depth understanding of the technical, strategic, and commercial aspects of digital marketing.

After all, working with wrong influencers can do more harm than good.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1766px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1766px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a397e7731143ca5bd9c_image1-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Youtube influencer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIbe_jjlONA\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa Raye unboxes </a><a href=\"https://www.revelnail.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Revel Nail</a>’s dip powder product and offers an exclusive coupon code from the brand. Working with influencers also gives your brand the opportunity to take advantage of that influencer’s broad network of followers in the form of a livestream. You can stream your unboxing videos and answer any customer questions in real-time. Live videos, a capability offered by Instagram along with many other social media platforms, provide the advantage of being able to talk to your customers in real-time. If they have any questions or concerns, they can share them right away using comments. You can address each of these live, as you unbox your product. </p><h2 id=\"\">Innovation: Get into Creative Uses For Your Product</h2><p id=\"\">One of the best ways unboxing videos can be used is to inspire new ways to use the product. This is where user-generated content can be a goldmine for ecommerce brands. Even if you’re reasonably certain your product is being used one way, chances are customers have shown it to be effective in other impactful ways. For example, <a href=\"https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tile</a>, which creates IoT based tracking devices for consumers, shows how customers can use Tile to locate their car. While Tile can be used in a variety of different ways, this specific use case solves a very unique problem for customers and indicates a way customers are clearly using the product.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1446px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1446px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a39a4b5062cde2400f6_image4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Authenticity: Keeping it Real While Still Promoting Effectively</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Unboxing videos work so well because they’re authentic, real and give consumers the feeling that they’re being educated instead of being marketed to. This is exactly why it’s important to preserve these elements that make unboxing videos so effective instead of trying to oversell — something that comes off as unauthentic.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Once you’ve settled on the right content creator, start by creating a detailed brief so that if you have any specific requirements that absolutely must to be a part of the video production process, they’re included. However give the influencer a chance to be themselves. The aim of the brief is to highlight essential requirements for the brand, not to micromanage your selected influencer.</p><p id=\"\">If your products are particularly detailed, try to avoid long introductions and use your product brief to specify this. You want viewers to learn as much about the product as quickly as possible without unnecessary promoting through a long, winding introduction. Try to have the videos get straight to the unboxing experience and talk about the features during the process instead of before or after. This way you don’t risk boring the viewer and letting them lose interest before they’re even halfway through.</p><p id=\"\">Remember that the influencers you select have the audience they do because they’re doing something right. Keep things authentic by giving them a chance to do what they do best. This includes allowing them to give authentic, unbiased feedback even if it’s about improvements or features they feel unsatisfied with while allowing them the creative freedom they're best at. That’s why the audience is watching after all.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Attention to Detail: Keep an Eye on the Things That Count</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Once most of the major aspects of an unboxing video are taken care of, the smaller details need to be ironed out. Although these aren’t things that most people notice immediately they certainly count and make a huge effect on the overall production quality of the video.</p><p id=\"\">Lighting and presentation are extremely important and your product needs to be unboxed in lighting that makes it look favorable and complements the colors of the product and packaging. Watch out for shadows and try to avoid harsh unpleasant lighting that interferes with the filming of the video.</p><p id=\"\">This could also be challenging depending on the backdrop selected for the video. The backdrop is another factor which plays a crucial part with regard to the impression the video creates. You want to select your background and video backdrop carefully before you begin filming. Perhaps a nice wooden table if you’re unboxing a health or wellness product or maybe a sleek work table for electronics. Decide what background looks best for close up shots and what location suits shots where you’re talking about the product while standing away from the camera.</p><p id=\"\">Being creative about the location you pick is a great way to keep your audience engaged. If the product is used outdoors maybe find a nice scenic spot where you can demonstrate how to use the product right after unboxing it. Remember that the point is to keep your audience engaged while you talk about the product so they don’t lose interest.</p><p id=\"\">Finally, it’s important to understand that an unboxing video is not a tutorial. You’re not trying to drill the specifications and details into the heads of your viewers. What a good unboxing video accomplishes is giving your viewers the feeling of opening presents on Christmas morning or on their birthdays. It makes them feel like they’re opening something they’ve waited a long time to buy and so your video needs to contain and capture those elements that people associate with gift unwrapping.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether that includes describing the texture of the packaging - which should be different from the standard packaging used during <a href=\"https://jeremynoronha.com/order-fulfillment-services/\" id=\"\">order fulfillment</a>, or recording the sound of paper tearing and plastic unwrapping, every tiny detail counts as part of the experience. The closer you can come to making your audience feel like they're in the room with you, the better the results. Aim to create the experience of good storytelling. Try writing out what you have to say and then reading it out loud to make sure it sounds great. Plan out the video before you start and try to <a href=\"https://bid4papers.com/blog/how-to-proofread-an-essay/\" id=\"\">proofread content</a> you plan on saying to make sure it sounds great out loud and not just in your head.</p><h2 id=\"\">Going Beyond: Use Unboxing Videos as Core Marketing Material</h2><p id=\"\">As powerful pieces of UGC, unboxing videos are repurposable; they can live on multiple different social channels, product pages, category pages, email communications, and even social media ads. One video might gain better traction revealing a new product in a social announcement, while others might benefit a product page by showing the different options a customer can choose from. &nbsp;For example, running a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media contest</a> encouraging customers to share their videos on social media is a great way to garner engagement and brand buzz while collecting valuable UGC for your various marketing channels. This can come in the form of a contest with the chance to win a discount or special prize, but sometimes even the opportunity to be featured on your brand’s accounts or website is enough incentive.</p><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"https://shanebarker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Shane Barker</em></a><em id=\"\"> is a digital marketing consultant who specializes in influencer marketing, content marketing, and SEO.

    "content": "<p>As 2020 gets us warmed up for a new decade of social media fun, TikTok is causing a growing buzz of popularity. The video-sharing platform, created by Beijing based internet technology company ByteDance, has quickly gained fans worldwide. As of February this year, <a href=\"https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok is estimated</a> to have more than one billion users.</p><p>TikTok might seem like an obvious win, but rushing in to use a new platform is one of the biggest mistakes that brands and businesses make. Making a strategic entrance into a channel without overcommitting resources is critical to long term success. Here are some mistakes you should avoid before launching into TikTok.</p><h2><strong>Not Checking if your Audience is Already Engaged on TikTok</strong></h2><p>There may be one billion people using TikTok, but are they already talking about your brand? What makes TikTok unique is that it lends itself to brand affinity across all categories, and a lot of that content is being created organically. One good way to find out if TikTok is right for your brand is to simply search and see if there's any existing content out there within your hashtag. Before launching into a new channel, it's important to understand the unique demographics using TikTok. &nbsp; </p><p>Be wary of overall demographic reports and look for ones that are relevant to your country or your audience’s country. For example, overall 60% of users are aged between 16-24 years old. However, 50% of users in the US are 18-34 years old.</p><h2><strong>Not Using Influencer &amp; User-Generated Content</strong></h2><p>TikTok is fun and easy to use. The vibe of the community using the app is relaxed and creative. An added benefit is that creating videos for TikTok is simple. That said, it still takes time to create that content. This is where <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/tiktok-marketing-strategies-for-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing and user-generated content on TikTok</a> can truly help you. This can help lower the cost of creating content and help you understand which types of content perform better.</p><h2><strong>Repurposing Other Content for TikTok</strong></h2><p>Each channel has it's own flavor, but TikTok is exceptionally creative. Many videos come in the form of challenges. Although it can be acceptable for other channels, TikTok is particularly averse to inauthentic content that doesn't feel 'made for the channel'. Your audience on TikTok wants to see the different sides of your brand personality and will not accept (what they see as) lazy, unoriginal, marketing. TikTok is a fun and relaxed place with no room for stiff corporate messaging. Relax, tap into your funny side and see what happens.</p><h2><strong>Not Understanding TikTok Ads </strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/advertise-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok ads</a>, while not used by many brands currently, are at least worth exploring. With a lack of saturation and a wide reach, these ads could be the next Facebook or Instagram ads. For right now, though, brands should at least understand how these ads work, and consider bolstering their influencer program in the meantime.</p><p>TikTok influencers are breaking records left, right and center. It comes as no shock that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2019/10/28/bts-shattered-another-world-recordthis-time-on-tiktok/#106b633318f8\" target=\"_blank\">K-Pop megastars BTS </a>are amongst the record-breaking TikTok users. Brands are forming clever partnerships to boost their products and services. There may be budget restrictions of course, but if you can put some marketing budget behind an influencer campaign it will be money well spent.</p><p>As TikTok continues to grow, the biggest mistake you can make is writing it off completely. Social channels are changing with the digitally native millennials and Gen Z – smart brands will continue to test new channels to keep relating to their audience authentically.</p><p>‍<em>Beatrix Potter is a professional marketing writer at </em><a href=\"https://oxessays.com/services/dissertation-writing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dissertation Writing</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://stateofwriting.com/undergraduate-writing-sevice-uk\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Stateofwriting</em></a><em> writing services.

Route allows your store to provide that information by offering always-on package tracking and order protection against damage, theft, or package loss.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2368px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2368px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63c87992de73bf4fc751eb31_Screen%20Shot%202023-01-18%20at%202.39.31%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Route Shopify App Listing\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Even better, Route allows you to offer customers Green Package Protection, an optional add-on that costs just 2% of the cart total for each customer.

With Joy, you can encourage customer loyalty by creating and implementing a spending point or rewards-earning system for your customers.

All in all, it’s a good way to help drive long-term customer relationships with the big spenders at your online store, helping to bring them back time and again.</p><h2 id=\"\">6.<a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/printful\" target=\"_blank\"> Printful</a></h2><p id=\"\">Printful is a print-on-demand Shopify app ideal for dropshipping and warehousing businesses.

If you have both <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/etsy-and-shopify\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">a Shopify and an Etsy shop</a>, why not combine the two to unify your customer base and make shopping easier for your target customers?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2368px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2368px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63c879ca130881ee842b6f7c_Screen%20Shot%202023-01-18%20at%202.44.03%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Route Shopify App Listing\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">You can do that with the Etsy integration.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Knowing the best time to post Reels on Instagram starts with understanding the rise of short-form video on Instagram and in general.</p><p id=\"\">When the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, announced in 2021 that Instagram was shifting its focus from being solely a photo-sharing app to one that focuses on video, social commerce, and messaging, some long-time Instagram fans were upset. With new features came new challenges to navigating the app, and, just like users, brands had to figure out how to adapt their social media marketing strategies to features like Instagram Reels.</p><p id=\"\">Whether you love it, think it’s a TikTok copycat, or have no opinion, there’s no doubt that <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-reels\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram Reels</a> are here to stay. In fact, <strong id=\"\">Reels most recently turned two years old</strong>, and it doesn’t look like Instagram has any plans of taking them down. To keep up with the trend, many companies and influencers are creating content for both Reels and TikTok to capture a broader range of audiences.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Instagram Reels often get far more than the number of likes an IGTV or in-feed video post might get. If you’re trying to gain more followers and increase the engagement rate of your content on Instagram, creating and posting Reels might just help you do that — but it’s essential to know the best time to post Reels on Instagram to maximize viewership and engagement.</p><h2 id=\"\">Is There an Ultimate Best Time to Post?</h2><p id=\"\">It depends. While the <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">global best time to post on Instagram</a> is on Wednesday at 11am, you’ll likely see more success by determining the right time to post based on your audience. To do this, you’ll want to determine where most of your audience base is.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Knowing where your audience is based could make all the difference in determining the success of your posts. For example, if many of your followers are based in Asia, it doesn’t make sense to post at 1 p.m.Eastern Standard Time (EST) on a Monday, because it would be 1 a.m. on a Tuesday in most parts of Asia.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">When’s the Best Time to Post Reels on Instagram?</h2><p id=\"\">After analyzing more than 100,000 short-form video content posts and Instagram Reels,<a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-reels/\" id=\"\"> Influencer Marketing Hub</a> has found that these are the best times to post Reels content (times in EST):</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Monday: 6:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:00 PM&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Tuesday: 2:00 AM, 4:00 AM, 9:00 AM</li><li id=\"\">Wednesday: 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 11:00 PM&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Thursday: 9:00 AM, 12:00 AM, 7:00 PM</li><li id=\"\">Friday: 5:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM</li><li id=\"\">Saturday: 11:00 AM, 7:00 PM, 8:00 PM</li><li id=\"\">Sunday: 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 4:00 PM</li></ul><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">A Hubspot study</a> also found that the highest engagement rate for Instagram Reels tends to be between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM. This is likely because most Instagram users are off work and school and free from other commitments.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Beyond these more generic time frames, here’s how you can determine the best time to post Reels on Instagram based on your unique follower base:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Create or Switch to a Business or Creator account</strong></h3><p id=\"\">With a Creator or Business account, you’ll be able to see how your Instagram account is doing.

Most marketers know this, but lack a scalable solution to build a cohesive brand story across various channels.</p><p id=\"\">In today’s digital landscape of TikTok, podcasts, <a href=\"https://dexatel.com/sms-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">SMS marketing services</a>, and more, there are virtually no limits to the places shoppers can consume media. Brand storytelling aligns with this trend; stories aren’t restricted in the way they can be conveyed.

Consider these three steps right at the start of your campaign-planning process to resonate with 2023 consumers.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Be Authentic and Relatable</h3><p id=\"\">The modern customer is not deceived by counterfeit or unoriginal brands. The first stage is determining what your brand's mission and values are. These principles may not be exclusive to your company, but your mission and ethos must be legitimate and aligned with the content you share online.</p><p id=\"\">Perhaps the most compelling way to be authentic in brand storytelling is by sharing <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) from real customers. Consumers are constantly sharing positive experiences with brands and products on social media, and resharing that content to your brand’s own channels demonstrates appreciation for your brand community while showing potential customers how your products could benefit them similarly.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/631a57c67473505d9af2b1ae_5EseLSQoFfxY_NUaZRMddaOlvI5RQ91ygLEcvykB7MnwZQJvEVqrotfyR01qxhxUv16lLujjBL3B9PdleroKsMyTQRB0zSYgdh1E7RlijUogSP2LrDLKONeckFPaislJQK-zRDDYbdZ-cmbER3Lbg6BLIU0-017Z9pNcTkKJWW0ZkDxens1BXtHb4g.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Brands like 24 Hour Fitness use Pixlee TurnTo to automatically collect, curate, and publish UGC from happy customers across their marketing channels, from shoppable online galleries to social media posts featuring these client stories.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This content strategy requires minimal work from a brand side while promoting trust and purchase confidence in the people who view it. UGC is <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">35% more memorable</a> than other media, and 50% more trusted because of its community-oriented, story-like qualities.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Actively Learn About Your Customers</h3><p id=\"\">Customers are the finest individuals to develop brand narratives. You want customers to identify with your brand and develop an emotional connection with you. What are their interests? What type of information excites them the most, and why? What are they not receiving from your competition that you could provide?</p><p id=\"\">One way to learn about your target audience is to simply spend time interacting with them on the platforms they’re most active on. Leading brands practice social listening to keep tabs on who’s talking about them or their industries, and to learn more about their customer base. This strategy can also help you identify potential advocates or <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-an-ambassador-marketing-program-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand ambassadors</a> for future storytelling campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This targeted knowledge can set your marketing and ecommerce teams up for success when it comes to boosting brand awareness. Your goal should be to determine <em id=\"\">where</em> your ideal customer spends their time online, <em id=\"\">what</em> kind of content they tend to engage best with, and <em id=\"\">when</em> the <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\" id=\"\">best time to post</a> and engage with them on social media are.</p><p id=\"\">By showing customers through storytelling how your products or services cater directly to them, you’re more likely to see a boost in success metrics like time spent on site and conversion rate, as you’re reaching a targeted group of consumers who are more likely to connect with your content.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1216px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1216px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a90b147405256e3f4ee_article-insta-post.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Article shows its appreciation for engaged community members in the comments of an Instagram post.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Place the Consumer at the Heart of the Narrative</h3><p id=\"\">One of the most significant marketing errors is making the product or service the protagonist of your narrative. By making the client the protagonist and reacting to their needs and desires, you have a significantly greater chance of attracting and converting them into <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/brand-evangelist\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand evangelists</a>.</p><p id=\"\">In addition to incorporating the way they talk about your brand into your marketing strategy, consider resharing the stories of customers in your community. Pet insurance company Trupanion frequently reshares UGC from pet owners in their community, often sharing positive experiences directly from the original post.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63571d3e9281bcd021e10ffb_w2DF-BLwA1_i6zHcQ9XumD-wPLJ09u0OrOD5ja2LOp_VKWr5P5VTH9s4hibxsgpS6HnCLs2UOjDYaiA2aaGpARskKUyPm-h0IV0YnSzlqbo_ugrkdS8DIffTPclYNoJ1FIDbi4AugmzUti0Nx3XX_1CrX3wFhztduO0DJsk8vhet4F3hIU4KnEyb.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">As this Instagram post shows, just resharing a customer’s photo inspired the customer to share her positive experience with Trupanion in a comment under the post. The more you interact with, acknowledge, and share content from your community, the more likely you are to identify your most passionate fans (who can continue to help you market community-first).</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Appeal to Your Audience’s Emotions</h2><p id=\"\">Customers want to feel happy interacting with brand content, which is why it’s crucial to tell a story that entertains, inspires, and/or educates consumers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Emotional appeals within a brand’s messaging and content inspire consumers to invest in that brand. People trust other people like them, and community-powered content like UGC and Ratings &amp; Reviews evoke an emotional response that helps your customer feel more connected to your brand.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63571d3d00fa35cd6068f33a_m5_aikUrJ4KLNhCHStFcwUIb0EfEH-k2A0YCpAcJW3c0PU5JGto7E4a7JkpsOBBbI7gguXIM8cH6fBpl4Rx0fBLIkaimBDEOxeAmFQWdVLTwKPJKnMjwIhmi6ORBobgNyQrTFi5vFNCysx2ydzx1vEKOjSGKTzDx1Ie2_3fFQioRsqVXJVXQHWjWAg.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Content that evokes emotion doesn’t have to be an in-depth video of a person; it can take many forms. Delta consistently tells its own brand story around sustainability, outlining in social posts and on-site the steps it's taking in real-time to become carbon neutral. The final sentence of this caption leans into users’ emotions by making them feel like a positive part of this sustainability initiative.</p><p id=\"\">Once a brand appeals to a part of a targeted audience through emotion, it must keep its grip by sharing an interesting and easy-to-follow story. There’s a reason why “<a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/news/story-time-crop-meaning-tiktok#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStory%20Time%E2%80%9D%20Meaning%20On%20TikTok&text=When%20you%20see%20the%20phrase,on%20parts%20of%20their%20video.\" id=\"\">story time</a>” is a popular trend on TikTok; users hook viewers at the start of the narrative and keep their attention until the end of the story. This same thinking can be applied to brand social media and other marketing content.</p><h2 id=\"\">Content Types That Tell a Brand Story</h2><p id=\"\">When you’re ready to start telling your brand’s story — be it on social media, your website, emails, or another channel — use the experiences of real people as the basis for your stories. This shows potential customers that you care about the same things they do and value your existing community.

Instead, you can encounter spammers, <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/3-ways-to-check-if-your-brand-influencer-has-fake-followers\" target=\"_blank\">fake followers</a>, impersonators, trolls, and other users with the potential to negatively impact your social strategy.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">As a marketer or ecommerce executive, it’s <strong id=\"\">vital to equip yourself with the right cybersecurity tools to protect yourself</strong> against common digital threats. While cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field that most marketers aren’t an expert in, staying on top of potential privacy and brand safety issues can drastically improve your brand’s digital strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Cybersecurity is Crucial for Everyone</h2><p id=\"\">First, let’s familiarize ourselves with<strong id=\"\"> some of the most common cybersecurity threats</strong> lurking out there. After all, knowing your opponent is the first step to victory.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">While the average person doesn’t have to worry about these threats constantly, social media influencers and marketers are more likely to be targeted because of their digital footprint and frequent activity on various platforms.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Phishing attacks. </strong>Hackers try to steal your account credentials by creating fake websites or emails where you have input your login details. Once you do that, they quickly log into your account and change the password, leaving you without access.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Social engineering attempts. </strong>Social engineering involves collecting personal information about the victim, impersonating someone they know, and crafting a personalized message. It’ll try to trick you into doing some activity (click on a link, send some money, etc.) for their benefit.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Virus-infected ads. </strong>The internet is rife with unwelcome advertisements that are intentionally difficult to remove. Sometimes clicking a suspicious ad’s call-to-action (CTA) also infects your device with malicious software, aka viruses.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Online trackers. </strong>Many are familiar with online cookies that collect metrics about browsing activities to craft a personalized experience. However, some can overstep their bounds and significantly undermine your digital privacy.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Malicious software. </strong>Like the infamous Trojan horse, trojan viruses enter your device by appearing as harmless necessities. They can take the form of email attachments, torrent files, and other freebies. These viruses can wreak havoc on your device in a wide range of ways.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Man-in-the-middle attacks. </strong>Using poorly secured public networks exposes you to interception and data theft. Hackers can even siphon your credit card information if you’re ever online shopping on the go.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Data leaks. </strong>Sometimes a website or online service contains a vulnerability that hackers exploit. Then your information ends up exposed through no fault of your own. Luckily, a good security tool will immediately inform you and suggest a course of action.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">As you can see, malicious actors have various options for targeting individuals. Thankfully, you can avoid these issues with a handful of tools and best practices. Many cybersecurity tools can prove beneficial to social media marketing specialists. Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id=\"\">Essential Social Media Cybersecurity Tools</h2><p id=\"\">Every person should have these three programs available before diving into the depths of the world wide web, especially social media managers running brand campaigns and collecting data from the internet.</p><h3 id=\"\">Virtual Private Network</h3><p id=\"\">Virtual Private Networks (or VPNs) are primarily used for anonymity. They grant it by <strong id=\"\">redirecting your connection through secure encrypted servers</strong> scattered worldwide. This maneuver hides a user’s actual whereabouts and IP address while making it appear that they are connecting from somewhere else.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Besides confidentiality, you can<a href=\"https://vpnpro.com/guides-and-tutorials/change-your-location-with-a-vpn/\" target=\"_blank\"> use a VPN to change your location</a> and bypass geographical restrictions or online censorship. A good VPN can also improve your connection speed and promote uninterrupted access to the social media networks you frequently interact with.</p><p id=\"\">Most importantly, <strong id=\"\">a VPN connection makes you immune to surveillance </strong>while your connection is protected against man-in-the-middle attacks. That means you need a VPN if you’re a fan of working in public spaces with Wi-Fi networks of varying quality and security levels.</p><h3 id=\"\">Password Manager</h3><p id=\"\">Reusing passwords is a recipe for disaster because a single data leak can potentially expose more than one account. As a social media marketer managing accounts across multiple social platforms, this is one of the best ways to protect your brand from being hacked.</p><p id=\"\">Luckily, password managers can remedy these issues by<strong id=\"\"> storing complex passphrases (and suggesting them) in a secure and easily accessible location</strong>. Then you won’t have to remember your passwords or worry about severely damaging data leaks. Best of all, some of the best services will notify you if your information is compromised.</p><h3 id=\"\">Antivirus Program</h3><p id=\"\">As the name suggests, antivirus programs<strong id=\"\"> protect your device against virus-infected software</strong>. It’s vital to pick reliable services for this task because new digital viruses are made practically everyday, which means you need equally-diligent protection. These tools will also scan your device and delete unnecessary files<strong id=\"\"> </strong>that hinder performance.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, most operating systems have default security measures in place. Plus, a VPN is capable of blocking malicious web domains used for distributing malware. Lastly, you won’t even need software solutions if you’re cautious and avoid suspicious files or links.</p><p id=\"\">It’s worth noting that some companies offer all three in one package, allowing you to cover every possible cybersecurity front conveniently. It’s crucial to research possible products if you want the best results — don’t just pick the least expensive option.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Marketers Benefit From Cybersecurity Tools</h2><p id=\"\">So far we’ve discussed how cybersecurity tools protect you and your online assets against digital dangers. <strong id=\"\">However, social media marketers can use these tools, VPNs in particular, to their advantage.</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Explore the web from a foreign perspective. </strong>Most websites tailor the experience differently to foreign markets. You won’t know what it looks like unless you change your location with a VPN. Then you can analyze how services appeal to different audiences, a valuable strategy for global brands.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Mask your identity. </strong>Some marketing campaigns require hiding your identity and place of origin. At the very least, you’d want the option to mask your IP address if it ever gets blocklisted for whatever reason.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Secure connections to shared resources.</strong> You can use business-oriented VPNs to protect crucial information and make it exclusive to your associates. Additionally, a VPN allows you to work remotely and retain access to essential resources anywhere.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Social media marketers and influencers must take cybersecurity seriously because they’re lucrative targets to online threats. You’ll need protection against spammers, impersonators, stalkers, and technical nuisances like ads or trackers. These tools can improve your business and research potential, so consider working with your team to ensure you have an optimal cybersecurity setup in place.</p>",

    "content": "<p>With brands like Kylie Cosmetics and Fashion Nova leveraging young influencers to skyrocket to enormous valuations overnight, it can sometimes seem like the whole world of social media influence stops with millennials and Generation Z.</p><p>But even brands that appeal more to baby boomers stand to benefit from building relationships with social media influencers. Boomers, in particular, are easily reached by influencer marketing as social media adoption within this demographic climbs. Already, boomers <a href=\"https://www.freeu.com/baby-boomers-social-media/\">spend more time on social media</a> on average than millennials and this demographic still accounts for the <a href=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/lifestyle-monitor/boomers-still-wield-mighty-retail-power-73033/\">largest economic force in the world</a>. The very premise of social influencer marketing -- trustworthy and charismatic individuals incorporating a brand into posts -- resonates with boomers who prefer word of mouth marketing.Learning how to effectively engage with boomers through influencer marketing, however, involves a different strategy than it does for millennials and Generation Z. Here are three tips for using influencer marketing and UGC to reach baby boomers.</p><p>‍<strong>Choosing the Right Influencers</strong>While younger generations dominate Instagram, baby boomers still prefer Facebook as their go-to platform. And unlike Instagram influencers that rely on compelling imagery, the success of Facebook influencers often hinges on compelling storytelling. Brands looking for <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-types-of-brand-influencers-which-one-is-right-for-you/\">influencer partnerships</a> on Facebook should locate public figures or <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\">microinfluencers</a> who have large boomer followings and then work on ways to organically incorporate product placement into posts. Since boomers spend a significant amount of time researching products, and are used to sharing brand advice with friends and family, trusted influencers that feature branded products are likely to be well received. Brands can also <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/7-steps-to-a-successful-influencer-marketing-strategy/\">work with influencers</a> to solicit UGC or product reviews from fans and then do round-ups that reinforce engagement with followers. Boomers are also on other platforms such as Instagram, where some of the top influencers are over the age of 50. For example, Martha Stewart has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marthastewart/?hl=en\">2.1 million followers</a> on Instagram and regularly provides fans with product recommendations that get significant engagement. <strong>Cut to the Chase</strong>Baby boomers want to know that a product is going to work as expected and therefore spend a lot of time researching before making a purchase. When targeting this demographic, brands can <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/2019-influencer-marketing-trends-for-brands/\">boost engagement and conversion rates</a> by telling influencers to earnestly discuss the benefits of a product or service at length. Boomers who are used to reading extensively about a product won’t view this abundance of information as oversharing or heavy-handed, and the more candid and relatable a influencer can be, the better. Whereas millennial influencers often showcase products in highly choreographed scenes with little accompanying text to create an aura of aspiration, boomer influencing is more likely to resemble a Yelp or Amazon review. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/product-ratings-and-ugc-both-work-but-can-they-work-together/\">Incorporating text ratings and reviews into your UGC</a> resonates best with these information-hungry individuals. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1024px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1024px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628ced62622e51958b3d70b9_Screen-Shot-2018-10-24-at-2.17.59-PM-1024x681.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018 10 24 at 2.17.59 PM\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>HYLETE incorporates reviews with UGC to give a well-rounded view of each product.</figcaption></figure><p>Influencers should also be prepared to link back to branded websites or include <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/shoppable-instagram\">shoppable links</a> so that boomers can further investigate what’s being offered. <strong>User-Generated Content </strong>Just as boomers like to learn as much as they can about a brand before making a purchase, they also like to see a product or service being used by one of their peers. Brands can leverage UGC in numerous ways to boost loyalty and engagement rates among boomer consumers. Brands can reach out to microinfluencers and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/nanoinfluencers-are-nothing-new-word-of-mouth-on-steroids/\">nanoinfluencers</a> to help expand a campaign’s reach through the strategic use of hashtags and buzzwords that can then lead to organic reaction posts from their followers. Brands can also solicit boomers directly for UGC in post-purchase emails, an offer that many consumers could see as an opportunity to share first-hand product reviews or simply to show their appreciation for a brand, through a channel they're very comfortable with.</p><p>Brands can also create <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\">social media contests</a> to gather UGC from boomers. This incentivizes boomers to follow the brand and adds value in joining the brand community.</p><p>Finally, brands can <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-repost-and-build-a-brand-community-on-instagram/\">deploy this UGC</a> in future marketing campaigns, on social platforms, and in shoppable product galleries to enhance the authenticity and relatability of their marketing efforts. With 72% of consumers saying that they consult social media <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/why-your-brand-needs-instagram-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\">before making a purchase</a>, and 92% of consumers expressing a preference for <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/why-testimonial-advertisements-still-matter/\" target=\"_blank\">personal testimonials</a>, companies can’t afford to miss out on growing their footprint among boomer influencers.</p>",

In fact, ads that feature UGC generate <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">four times higher </a>click-through-rates than those without and are considered <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">50% more trustworthy</a> than other types of media.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.aloyoga.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alo Yoga</a> showcases Instagram posts from its customer community on-site, with shoppable tags for easy product navigation.The best thing about it? It’s effortless yet valuable content. But like any other form of marketing, it <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-create-an-adaptable-content-strategy-with-user-generated-content/\" target=\"_blank\">has to be executed strategically</a>. Otherwise, you could be doing more harm than good. We’ve come up with a list of dos and don’ts to help guide you through creating an adaptable UGC strategy. </p><h2><strong>Dos</strong></h2><h3><strong>Ask </strong><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/gain-your-customers-trust-with-permissioned-content/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Permission</strong></a></h3><p>Even if you’re just resharing a customer photo on social media, crediting the original poster is not enough. It’s always important to secure proper consent, even if you were tagged by a public account. Because the rules on copyright in social media can get blurry and confusing, it’s always better to be cautious. But don’t lose hope, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/gain-your-customers-trust-with-permissioned-content/\" target=\"_blank\">85% of people</a> are willing to grant permission for brands to use their content.</p><p>Pixlee’s user-generated content CRM platform allows brand teams to ask for permission with the click of a button; by making it clear to users that a specific hashtag means they’re allowing you to reuse their content, you can streamline the connection of already-permissioned UGC.</p><h3><strong>Plan Before Sharing</strong></h3><p>Treat UGC like any other piece of marketing content. Does it fit your overall brand message or align with a specific campaign? This is important for both social media channels and more traditional marketing endeavors, like email campaigns or on-site <a href=\"https://pixlee.com/use-cases/lookbooks-and-inspiration-galleries\" target=\"_blank\">inspiration galleries</a>. Make sure the content blends well with your brand aesthetic and style. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/dining/avalon/descanso-beach-club-dining/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Catalina Island’s UGC gallery</a> specific to its Descanso Beach Club features beachy posts by customers.</p><p>To help you curate your UGC, Pixlee allows you to pick and choose from existing posts by your fans to find the content that is right for your brand. </p><h3><strong>Engage and Encourage Interaction</strong></h3><p>Ask, and you shall receive! Use features like Polls and Question stickers on <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/why-we-love-the-new-instagram-stories-archive-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram Stories </a>to your advantage. You can also ask questions in your captions that stimulate discussion about your brand or product. This will not only get you free and awesome content but also a chance for some honest insight. Gathering quotes from your customers is an easy and no-fail content piece that can be used on your grid or timeline and even as an ad. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a4a8278a940cccdb22d_limecrime-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>A <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLqxYoLsrHS/\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> by <a href=\"https://limecrime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lime Crime</a> on Instagram shows customer reviews for a new product, sparking conversation in the comments.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Use Unique Hashtags </strong></h3><p>Hashtags will help you streamline UGC collection from &nbsp;your chosen social media platform as well as keep track of your own reposted UGC. Having unique branded hashtags for specific campaigns will also help you monitor performance, engagement rate, and mentions. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a4abbbd263a05a5f42b_Screen-Shot-2021-03-28-at-9.59.34-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://training.allmaxnutrition.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ALLMAX Nutrition</a> features a site page dedicated to training and workout inspiration, encouraging fans to share their content with the product, tagging #ALLMAXTraining.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Don’ts</strong></h2><h3><strong>Take Shortcuts</strong></h3><p>Before posting on any official company channel, don’t forget to ask the poster to verify the source. Ensuring that each piece of content is original and authorized can be tricky to scale without a platform like Pixlee that can be configured to ensure users are authorized to share the content. Reposting an image can seem pretty harmless, but in the age of social media where catfishing and trolling are rampant, there’s no harm in playing it safe. A user with no profile picture or very few followers can be a sign of a <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-run-a-fake-instagram-followers-audit/\" target=\"_blank\">fake account</a>, for example. </p><h3><strong>Limit Yourself to Large-Scale Influencers</strong></h3><p>Influencer marketing is the fastest growing channel for customer acquisition, and businesses make <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\">$6.50 for every dollar</a> invested in influencer marketing. But while content posted by influencers may result in more engagement than your average customer, don’t overlook your everyday fans. Focusing on “real people” — rather than just famous models or celebrities — will make your brand more relatable. Using real people and their stories can also encourage more engagement and build a stronger connection with your customers. One successful way to utilize <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a> without shooting for the accounts with millions of followers is through partnering with micro influencers. These individuals typically have 1,000-100,000 followers, may already be fans of your brand, and tend to see much <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencer-marketing-a-guide-to-getting-better-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">higher levels of sustained engagement</a> because of their niche, targeted, and loyal followings.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1580px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1580px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a165a1275249a521173_Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-2.38.17-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.revelnail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Revel Nail</a>’s micro-influencers share their favorite manicures with a dedicated community of nail polish enthusiasts.</p><h3><strong>Keep Content Confined to One Channel</strong></h3><p>Most UGC comes from social media, but that doesn't mean it has to stay there. Don’t be afraid to pop UGC into your other marketing channels such as email, ads, in-store displays, and, for ecommerce brands, everywhere on your site. The versatility of UGC is one of the many benefits that make it such a valuable marketing tool; there’s no end to where this type of content can be utilized.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hylete.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HYLETE</a> uses UGC depicting “worn out” athletes in brand gear on its unsubscribe page to convey how many of us feel about emails; this is a creative place to share community photos while drawing the shopper back into your brand.</p><h3><strong>Forego Seasonally Irrelevant Content </strong></h3><p>The truth about UGC is you’ll often find a lot of content that is older, or more relevant to previous campaigns. Even if that content isn’t relevant for your current product line or the season, requesting permission to use it can still be beneficial for your brand. Chances are, you’ll need content for that season or product line again – and having more UGC saved to can benefit you in the long run, saving time and scaling resources. Plus, by engaging with that customer who shared the post, you’ll create a new and personal engagement with someone who is likely to share more UGC with your brand in the future. Beyond collecting that content, it’s a great way to build customer engagement with already highly-engaged customers.</p><p>Utilizing UGC is a win-win for everyone and a hot trend among consumers –– that’s why <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\">87% of all brands</a> already use it for free, authentic content. It means less work for you content-wise and recognition for your customers. If you’re just starting out and don’t have many tags or reviews just yet, it’s perfectly acceptable to incentivize your customers through a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\">social media contest</a> to get the ball rolling; this means encouraging your followers to share pictures involving your brand or product in exchange for a discount or giveaway. Your preferred social platform is waiting to become a goldmine of user-generated content waiting to be shared by your brand.</p><p>‍<em>Denise Langenegger is part of the team at </em><a href=\"https://www.instasize.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instasize</em></a><em> – a content creating tool kit for anyone editing photos and online content on mobile.</em></p>",

Copywriters are required to produce content that is punchy, informative, and interesting — often used on an ecommerce website or on social media. In the world of e\\commerce, a copywriter’s role is to engage users of online shopping platforms (potential clients) who are interested in purchasing products or services.</p><p id=\"\">Copywriters create a variety of content, including sales copy, adverts, emails, product descriptions, and more. They also produce non-digital content like direct mail and video scripts.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Copywriters obviously need a strong writing background, but beyond that, they need to be creative. In an online world filled with distractions, their primary objective is to convince people to pay attention.</p><p id=\"\">Ecommerce is expanding at a phenomenal rate due to a record number of direct-to-consumer companies continuing to gain traction in this online industry. This means that more jobs continue to become available in this challenging and ever-evolving industry.

    "content": "<p>One of the most profitable selling tools, email marketing offers a high-value connection between marketers and clients and will likely be relevant for decades to come. As of today, email still delivers the highest ROI for marketers, generating an average of 38$ for every 1$ spent, according to <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/\">CampaignMonitor</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:512px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"512px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29b8c8e3f22531fe348a_1.png\" alt=\"1\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Your business can’t afford to ignore email marketing and waste its potential. And what’s more, <strong>you don’t even need to rely on discounts or wait for special offers in order to sell with email marketing</strong>. &nbsp;Because when you forge solid relationships with your audience, they won’t simply buy more often. They will support and defend your brand at all costs and recommend your products to their friends -- becoming free promoters in the process.</p><p>While many tricks for improving email conversion rely on heavy discounts and sales, some of the best email campaigns perform well because they're personalized and connect with their customers. What's more, by reducing your reliance on discounts, your email ROI will increase. Here are some ways brands are using their emails as a community-building channel.</p><h2><strong>1. Build Trust with Your Audience by Conveying Brand Value </strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2019-07/2019_edelman_trust_barometer_special_report_in_brands_we_trust.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">81% of consumers</a> need to trust a brand before buying from it. That’s how important it is to build rapport with your email audience before even thinking about selling anything. Positioning your brand as an industry authority will make it easier for people to trust you and buy from you. To do this, send emails where you provide real value to your audience and become close to your prospects. Start building relationships with them and these potential customers will eventually feel inclined to buy from your brand.</p><p>Marketers often invoke ideas from &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/reciprocity-principle/\" target=\"_blank\">Cialdini’s rule of reciprocity</a>, which explains that humans tend to return valuable favors given to them. And applying it is simple, you give something valuable for your audience (information, education, tools, gifts, etc) so they eventually return the favor by becoming a customer.</p><p>Emails that are perfect for this practice include:</p><ul> \t<li>Email newsletters.</li> \t<li>Welcome email sequences.</li> \t<li>Lead nurturing series.</li> \t<li>New content announcements (such as new blogs, webinars, or videos).</li></ul><p>Starbucks provides value in its email newsletters, which are often packed with coffee recipes you can try at home (while promoting its brand in the process).</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:527px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"527px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29b7057fb5fe8585f0bf_2.jpeg\" alt=\"2\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://easysendy.com/blog/e-commerce-email-marketing-examples/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SOURCE</strong></a></p><p>This works; If you know how to make good coffee, you know how good Starbucks is, and you’ll feel more favorably toward buying from the brand.</p><h2><strong>2. Use User-Generated Content to Improve Relevancy </strong></h2><p>To stand out in your prospect’s inbox, utilize more engaging methods like storytelling, customer reviews, and user-generated content. In short, you can sell more just by using the customer feedback you’re getting for free, serving as proof that your brand is legit and that your products are good. This is a powerful way to leverage user-generated content. Plus, with email marketing, since your customers are already opted-in to communication, you've likely got a better understanding of who they are and which data categories they fall into. With this, you can use UGC to create broadly personalized emails that don't feel too personal.</p><p>Collecting <a href=\"http://www.pixlee.com\">user-generated content</a> from your brand community is the first step – sharing that content across channels like email is the best way to uplevel your UGC game. For example, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/resources-page?cs=kirkland-s-uses-pixlee-to-keep-content-fresh-community-engaged-during-covid-19\">Kirkland’s</a> uses UGC from customers to promote its furniture and inspire potential customers with a gallery of authentic images. These images aren't only easy to come by, they also convert better. <strong>Kirkland's saw a fourteen percent increase in average order value after using UGC.</strong></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29b8889fbd425b138eef_3.png\" alt=\"3\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>User-generated content is a proven way to improve your email marketing results. So if you want to increase your emails’ CTR, there’s no better time to begin implementing UGC.</p><h2><strong>3. Send Warm Welcome Emails with Customer Reviews</strong></h2><p>There’s nothing more welcoming than seeing other people making the same decisions as you, and achieving success. You can take advantage of this when people are brand new to your list.To make the most out of your welcome emails, it is critical to leverage your brand’s first impression, and to do the following:</p><ul> \t<li>Showcase how your customers have been using your products.</li> \t<li>Guide the viewer through the best content for them.</li> \t<li>Teach them how to use your products.</li></ul><p>A warm welcome will leave a nice first impression, and make it easier for new leads to believe in your brand and stick with you. <a href=\"https://www.bollandbranch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boll &amp; Branch</a> uses buyer testimonials to help new subscribers get a feel for their products and how other customers rate them, while indirectly promoting these products.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:671px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"671px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29b81323ed22702f6d10_4.png\" alt=\"4\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-welcome-email-examples\"><strong>SOURCE</strong></a></p><p>What’s great about these testimonials is that you get educated about their products when you read them. When you begin showcasing customers who are excited about your products, it is just a matter of time until you get an army of brand promoters freely creating UGC for your marketing efforts. </p><h2><strong>4. Reengage Subscribers by Showing Your Brand Values</strong></h2><p>It is known that <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/database-decay#:~:text=Email%20marketing%20databases%20naturally%20degrade,up%20for%20these%20lost%20contacts.\" target=\"_blank\">email lists degrade by 22.5% every year</a> due to subscribers changing their emails, becoming inactive, or simply because they unsubscribed.</p><p>Some of your subscribers are simply no longer engaged with your brand. Maybe because they only bought once, got technical problems with deliverability/ check out/UX, or they forgot about your brand over time. The re-engagement campaign goal is to remind them how great your brand is, and why they should pay attention to you again.</p><p>Best practices for re-engagement campaigns include:</p><ul> \t<li>Showing how others are getting positive results from your products.</li> \t<li>Providing exclusive content, support, or any irresistible offer.</li> \t<li>Reminding the consumer of the last time they bought, and giving personalized recommendations and tips.</li></ul><p>Some of the best re-engagement campaigns tease subscribers to revisit their website by giving them a limited-time coupon. OleHenriksen reminds its audience of its brand values without pushing for consumers to make a purchase on the spot. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:380px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"380px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29b7cb502c3503e9d056_olehenrikson-ecommerce-re-engagement.png\" alt=\"olehenrikson ecommerce re engagement\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://emaildesign.beefree.io/5-e-commerce-re-engagement-emails-to-win-back-customers/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SOURCE</strong></a></figcaption></figure><p>These types of emails make it easy for the reader to unsubscribe, which can sometimes be beneficial in cleaning up your brand’s email list to maintain potential customers who may still have an interest in buying while weeding out those who do not.</p><h2><strong>5. Send Personalized Product Recommendations</strong></h2><p>Product recommendation emails that are well-personalized bring more results than you think. According to <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/personalized-product-recommendations/#use-your-data\" target=\"_blank\">BigCommerce</a>, personalized product recommendations increase conversion rates by 150%, average order value by 50%, and <strong>overall revenue by 300%</strong>. This is only possible when you recommend products based on segmentation, browsing behavior, and specialized algorithms, which is not as complex as it seems. You can begin product personalization by identifying at least 5 different segments in your list based on previous responses and shopping behaviors. Then, create campaigns that are personalized for each segment.</p><p>The algorithm -- depending on your email software -- will then highlight the most relevant products in your promotional emails. Whether or not you already practice audience segmentation, this won’t be rocket science for you.</p><p>Some of the best practices for product recommendations include:</p><ul> \t<li>Optimizing product recommendations for all devices</li> \t<li>Including large, high-quality images for each product to make it more likely the recipient will click</li> \t<li>Using a specialized algorithm for each user segment based on past behavior, ensuring the most relevant recommendations for your prospects</li> \t<li>Avoiding overlapping emails, making sure that each prospect receives only one recommendation message</li> \t<li>Including product recommendations in your cart abandonment emails</li> \t<li>Hiding recommended product prices to maintain intrigue and curiosity, improving your CTR</li></ul><p>Mastering personalization will position your brand as a trustful authority. If you don’t adapt to personalization needs, your competitors will, and your business will stagnate. On the other hand, If you do adapt, you’ll have a huge advantage over those who don’t and your brand will have more bandwidth to thrive.</p><p>Email marketing will remain relevant for a long time. It has a low entry barrier and high ROI potential, so it is a safe bet for almost any business to invest in email. Providing your audience with valuable emails backed with testimonials and UGC holds a significant advantage over frequent, impersonal promos and discounts. Designing your brand’s reimagined email campaign doesn’t have to be difficult if you bear in mind some of these key concepts: customer experience, a welcoming approach, reengagement, and personalized product recommendations. You don’t need discounts to sell, and your brand will likely be more profitable without that typical email structure, so use these tips to begin reshaping <a href=\"https://www.moengage.com/blog/8-email-marketing-strategies-you-should-be-implementing/\">your email marketing strategy</a> today.</p><p>Kevin is a freelance SaaS copywriter and content creator.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Making waves in the marketing world can be a challenge for all businesses. Fortunately, there’s one marketing strategy you can employ to increase your sales, conversion rates, and level of brand loyalty all in one go. That strategy is ambassador marketing. Ambassador marketing is one of the best ways to inspire brand loyalty and see those sales figures rise. But what is ambassador marketing? How do you leverage that type of marketing in the first place? You’ll learn all those in this article. Read on! </p><h2 id=\"\">Ambassador vs Creator – what is the difference?</h2><p id=\"\">Many people think that ambassadors and creators are one and the same. Sure, the things they do might overlap, but they have their differences as well. First, an ambassador represents a brand or promotes a product. Some ambassadors serve as brand advocates because they have a long history of using the brand, but most ambassadors are paid by the brands they represent. Additionally, ambassadors may have less creative freedom over the content they create because they are looking to align with the brand's goals and expectations.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, a creator does not necessarily represent a brand. Most content creators start out by publishing content in their niche without any sponsorships. As their following grows, they may attract brands who will sponsor their content. However, a creator is typically known for having more creative control: the content they create aligns with their personal brand. Their main goal is to attract and engage new audiences and the content mostly exists because the creator is passionate about whichever brand they are creating content for. Creators usually depend on audience contributions or platform monetization for a living, a phenomenon known as the <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-creator-economy-as-a-marketer/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">creator economy</a>.</p><p id=\"\">Big brands like Red Bull differentiate between their ambassadors and their creators by having their own ambassador programs while also tapping influencers of all sizes for different marketing campaigns. For example, Red Bull has its <a href=\"https://jobs.redbull.com/us-en/microsite/student-marketeer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Student Marketeer program</a> in addition to its <a href=\"https://jobs.redbull.com/us-en/microsite/musketeer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Musketeers program</a> that allows students to become Red Bull brand ambassadors where they represent the brand in a certain way, seek new opportunities for the brand, and distribute products on their campuses to build brand awareness. On the other hand, Red Bull also uses influencers for its marketing campaigns, including featuring UGC on its website, demonstrating that sometimes the best influencers are fans of the brand who create their own content without a sponsorship. &nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1410px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1410px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2bca60d10a483053cc7b_Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-7.25.56-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Despite these two main differences, ambassador marketing can and does work alongside the creator economy in promoting brand and products. There is a rather large intersection between the two sets of creatives. In the next section, let’s take a look at the things ambassadors and creators have in common. </p><h2 id=\"\">Ambassadors are Often a Type of Creator</h2><p id=\"\">With the rise of social influence across digital channels, the line between the ambassadors and creators has become blurred. Many ambassadors are also creators and many creators are also ambassadors. The difference often lies in the formality of relationship the creator has with the brand.Rather than over-fixating on the distinguishing characteristics between an ambassador and a content creator, it’s important to acknowledge the role community content more broadly plays in the customer journey. Ambassador and creator content should provide valuable social proof for consumers interested in your brand – regardless of the nomenclature.</p><p id=\"\">Brands like MixTiles use ambassador marketing to enhance brand awareness and promote products. Melissa Connelly, a blogger and LGBTQ+ advocate who discusses relationships, love, and queer life partnered with MixTiles and promotes the brand on her Instagram page. The post leveraged engagement and generated nearly 800 likes. &nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2090px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2090px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2bcb1323ed94b72f810b_Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-1.40.50-PM-e1638407548248.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">How to Manage your Ambassadors and Creators</h2><p id=\"\">An ambassador creator strategy is a two-way street. While ambassadors and creators deliver branded content to engage customers, your brand must be able to nurture and maintain those relationships. However, it is time-consuming and difficult to do on your own. In order to sustain and measure relationships while also managing several unique types of community content, brands should consider using an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing platform</a> to accomplish these tasks all in one place.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Audit Your Existing Community Content</h3><p id=\"\">What many brands should come to realize is that the best content creators may be existing customers who are already a fan of your brand and who have already posted content on their personal social media pages. You can use a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">UGC platform</a> to cost-effectively find and collect community content to feature on-site to leverage engagement and increase conversion. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas used Pixlee to collect and manage existing user-generated content to showcase customer experience. The brand knew that there was an abundance of content out there from customers but needed a way to find and collect it. With <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pixlee</a>, The Cosmopolitan collected <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">over 19,000 pieces of content</a>, which produced over 250 million impressions. By capitalizing on existing community content, The Cosmopolitan was able to authentically increase engagement on its Shoppable Instagram gallery with an engagement rate of 42%. &nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Discover Creators &amp; Ambassadors that Align with Your Brand</h3><p id=\"\">Finding the right people is critical. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-savvy-tips-to-find-the-perfect-influencer-for-your-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Selecting the right influencer</a> or content creator could transform your brand. Choosing someone who doesn't accurately represent you could tarnish your reputation. With Pixlee’s <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions-page-pixlee-for-creators\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer discovery platform</a>, you can find influencers based on size, interests, location, engagement rate, and more to maximize your brand’s impact. Choose someone who has a high degree of professionalism. They need to be trustworthy and committed. They should also have a passion for your brand. Their authenticity will shine through if they are genuine fans of your products. They should also have a degree of relevance to your brand. For example, if you’re selling mobile phone cases, choosing someone who’s already into tech (such as a technology blogger or YouTuber) would be appropriate. If you’re selling leather goods, it might not be wise to choose someone vegan and into animal rights! Brand ambassadors should also contribute to your goals effectively. Evaluate their skills and see how those skills can contribute to your brand goals. For example, if you’re looking to create content, choose a content creator who doesn’t take any shortcuts, understands your niche, and has knowledge of your industry. &nbsp;Once you have found the right influencers for your brand with an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions-page-pixlee-for-creators\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing platform</a>, you can easily manage relationships with your creators and ambassadors all in one place.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Track Content &amp; Ambassador Performance</h3><p id=\"\">Finally, keep track of how your ambassador marketing campaign is performing. Check for the number of engagements, conversion rates, and above all - the quality and value of content. User-generated content provides high value as it can continue to impact KPIs on different channels even after the campaign is over. High-quality content can be used in on-site displays, email marketing, Shoppable Instagram, and more to continue to generate value for brands. Nixon, Inc. funnels engagement by spreading Pixlee-powered UGC onto other channels beyond its initial usage on social media platforms like Instagram, which has translated to high engagement rates on-site. Through spreading content on other channels like the brand’s website, Nixon saw a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/nixon\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">24% increase</a> in on-site repeat visits. &nbsp; &nbsp;The most effective way of building brand ambassadors is to work with content creators. They specialize in creating organic content that speaks to their audience and enjoy credibility within their niche. While we can acknowledge that there are differentiating characteristics between ambassadors and creators, we can agree that content produced by both proves invaluable to KPI optimization. </p><p id=\"\">‍<em id=\"\">Matt Caron is a content marketer, writer, editor, manager, community builder, and UX/UI architect.

For example, U.S. TikTok influencers alone had an <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1166174/usa-tiktok-influencer-engagement-rate-us-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">average engagement rate of 17.99%</a>.

Use Paid Ads</h3><p id=\"\">The TikTok crowd is more welcoming toward paid ads than you think. A study found that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/6-takeaways-from-our-latest-kantar-study\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">72% of users enjoy ads</a> on TikTok. And they start from $10 per CPM. Try one or more formats to see which ones bring the best results. Here are your options: </p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">In-feed ads</strong>. These ads appear on the users’ For You page with the “sponsored” label attached.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Brand takeovers</strong>. Brand takeovers are usually the very first video when you open the app and also get to appear in multiple spots of TikTok.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Topview ads</strong>. These ads appear on the top of the For You page. TikTok’s ad page states that you get “leading access to user attention” with the TopView ads.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Branded effects ads</strong>. These ads allow you to create shareable stickers, filters, or effects about your brand. </li></ul><h3 id=\"\">4. Reshare <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/what-are-instagram-reels/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram Reels</a> Content</h3><p id=\"\">For brands active on Instagram, resharing successful content you’ve created for reels or IGTV posts is a good strategy. Plus, reels also serve as another place to collect customer UGC from that can later be repurposed to TikTok. While brands are already repurposing much of their Instagram content on other impactful owned digital channels, Reels content could be incredibly powerful for things like TikTok or Twitter ads. This applies to both brand-generated content and UGC — as they work best together.</p><h2 id=\"\">Start Your TikTok Journey Today!</h2><p id=\"\">TikTok has a lot of unrealized potential for brands.

    "content": "<p>The global internet users grew by 8.6% over the past year, and ecommerce now accounts for over 13% of all retail revenue, according to the <a href=\"https://www.buildthis.io/online-shopping-ecommerce-internet-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">latest figures</a>. There’s a lot of money on the table if you know where to look. Marketers tend to obsess over how to approach different age groups online, and this makes sense. Baby Boomers have different preferences than the preceding generation, and the same applies to Generation X and Millennials. But, if you’re ready to feel really old, here’s what you need to know about how to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. </p><h2>Who Are Gen Z and Gen Alpha?</h2><p>Gen Z is referred to as the “post-Millennials.” These are people born from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. More specifically, they are today’s teenagers and young adults (early 20s). This means that the oldest members of this generation are in college, just graduating, or just entering the workforce. Gen Alpha is a much younger group, but don’t write them off just yet. They have birth dates starting in 2010, so most of this generation are still in wearing diapers, learning to walk, or have yet to be born. The oldest in the group is about nine years old. The term “Gen Alpha” was coined by a consultant and researcher in Australia named <a href=\"http://mccrindle.com.au/the-mccrindle-blog/gen-z-and-gen-alpha-infographic-update\" target=\"_blank\">Mark McCrindle</a>, who predicts that there are 2.5 million Alphas born each week. This generation will also number a staggering 2 billion people by 2025. </p><h2>How Brands Can Appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha</h2><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.buildthis.io/online-shopping-ecommerce-internet-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">recent survey</a>, Gen Z respondents overwhelmingly prefer to shop online. Only about half (56%) purchased items in a physical store over the past six months and 30% look at ads for products on social media. For the most part, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-7-best-digital-marketing-blogs-for-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">brands and digital marketers</a> will approach Gen Z and Gen Alpha in a similar manner. These are generations that have been exposed to technology all of their lives, so they have many of the same characteristics. If your company is looking for ways to appeal to these groups, here are some tips:</p><h3>Be Authentic</h3><p>Both Generation Z and Gen Alpha <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20875523/youth-climate-strike-fridays-future-photos-global\" target=\"_blank\">care deeply about the world</a>. They are acutely aware of the socio-economic, political, and environmental problems that face society today.According to one <a href=\"https://nrf.com/research/gen-z-brand-relationships\" target=\"_blank\">study by the National Retail Federation</a>, <strong>55% of Gen Z members choose brands that are socially responsible and eco-friendly</strong>. If your business wants to be successful with these groups, it needs to care about more than making money. Your business not only needs to have a strong set of values, but those values also need to be represented in its brand.Here are a few ways that can make brands stay authentic in front of the new generations:</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Be real</strong> - Go back to the basics and discover the most important elements for your brand by answering these simple questions like Who are you? What’s your purpose? What do you stand for? What’s your bran social responsibility? </li> \t<li><strong>Be accountable</strong> - You need to take initiative to answer customer’s questions when something is not going well with your brand. An example of how <a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/leadership/how-patrick-doyle-changed-dominos-restaurant-industry\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Doyle, Domino’s Pizza CEO</a>, was reacting to customer feedback.</li> \t<li><strong>Be consistent</strong> - You can start by making brand manifesto as a guideline whenever you approach different marketing strategies from social media to content marketing. &nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Personalize the Web Experience</h3><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/use-personalization-increase-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Insights</a>, a majority (94%) of marketers in one study see personalization of the online experience as vital to success. And this is particularly the case when it comes to appealing to younger audiences. There is so much data available to marketers now that it would be silly not to take advantage of it and personalize the experience for your visitors. While you shouldn’t overreach and compromise a user’s privacy (more on that in a minute), younger visitors expect personalization. Some of the ways that brands can <a href=\"https://blog.cs-cart.com/2019/08/27/4-strategies-to-implement-personalization-in-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">personalize the user experience</a> to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha include: </p><ul> \t<li><strong>Enhancing Website Personalization</strong> - You can use customer browsing and location data to personalize a visitor's experience. One of the best examples of this is <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/creating-a-recommendation-engine-using-amazon-personalize/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com’s recommendation engine</a>.</li> \t<li><strong>Personalized Retargeting </strong>- You can create a series of retargeted ads that entice users to return to your website and revisit products or an abandoned shopping cart.</li> \t<li><strong>Personalized Social Media Campaigns</strong> - You can personalize the message on social media by directly engaging with visitors as well as using such things as chatbots, personalized gifts, and customized videos.</li></ul><h3>Use Social Media to Boost Engagement</h3><p>There are plenty of ways to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/pixlee-turns-social-media-trends-into-online-catalogs/\" target=\"_blank\">market with social media</a>, but not all of them are going to appeal to these two targeted audiences. One of the things you should do is make it easy for your site's visitors to share your brand and content by placing social media links on your website.</p><p>Major brands are experimenting with ways to reach younger audiences on social media platforms. Facebook is even targeting Gen Alphas with a new messaging app called <a href=\"https://messengerkids.com/\">Facebook Messenger Kids</a>. But, according to <a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/survey-reveals-generation-z-is-driven-digital-touchpoints-identify-products-but-prefers-2201477.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Market Wired</a>, Instagram remains the most popular app for brand discovery among teens.</p><h3>Simplify the Shopping/Checkout Experience</h3><p>While Gen Z and Gen Alpha aren't lazy by any means, they have no desire to do things that technology should be able to take care of easily. In short, you should be able to simplify the shopping and checkout experience for these customers.</p><p>Allow them to log into your website using their social media accounts. Be transparent about your shipping costs, and cut down on the steps required to complete the checkout process. </p><h3>Respect Their Privacy</h3><p>Even as you personalize online experiences for young users, it’s vital that you highlight your commitment to privacy protection. <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4165473/n-gen-White-Paper-Gen-Z.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NGen</a> reports that 88% of Gen Z believes that protecting privacy is “important.” While most (66%) of young users say they feel comfortable sharing personal data with brands they trust, they want to know that their information is being protected and securely stored. Ensure that you are using strong encryption on your website, and include a clear Privacy Policy on all of your sites and social media channels. Here are some suggestions to make privacy a brand opportunity:</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Be GDPR compliant</strong> - Implement privacy settings to your digital products and websites by default and let customers know how you will handle their personal data.</li> \t<li><strong>Choose the right partner</strong> - Brand needs to be extra careful when it comes to choosing partners, especially data providers. Although third party consumer data is essential for business growth, misuse of data will cause a negative brand reputation. </li> \t<li><strong>Show commitment to security</strong> - Only <a href=\"https://press.pwc.com/News-releases/organisations-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-data-privacy/s/b56bf806-5712-4462-98a1-161c1a3f9cbe\" target=\"_blank\">51%</a> of businesses are serious of where personal data for employees and customers are being used. Brands need to show a serious commitment to ensuring strict compliance towards data privacy.</li></ul><h2>What is Different About Gen Alpha?</h2><p>Gen Alpha does have some unique characteristics. A majority of these children aren’t growing up with traditional “toys,” but rather have stared at digital screens since birth. They are incredibly tech-savvy, and often influence the buying behavior of their millennial parents. Members of Gen Alpha themselves have become some of the strongest advocates for brands, through <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-boost-your-product-launch-with-influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a>. These “kidfluencers” begin pushing brands on social media before they can walk, and their peers take notice. Ryan, the top Gen Alpha YouTube star, has 22.2 million followers and reportedly earned $22 million last year demonstrating and reviewing toys <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GM0E93B-Ztg\" target=\"_blank\">on his channel</a>.</p><p>According to research released by <a href=\"https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/insights/what-does-the-future-hold-for-generation-alpha/\" target=\"_blank\">Grant Thornton</a>, Gen Alphas are expected to have the longest life expectancies in history, be the most educated, and the most wealthy. If your brand hasn’t begun thinking about how to attract and build loyalty with this group, and its predecessors, it’s time to start. </p><p>‍<em>Jason is an internet marketer who loves to blog about internet marketing tips, website building tips, online business ideas and many more.

    "content": "<p>When you think about best web experiences, you probably don’t think of pizza companies first. Over the past 5 years, Domino’s Pizza has built an impressive, and immersive, digital experience that rivals many traditional e-commerce brands. <strong><em>This article originally appeared in </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewong/2018/01/26/how-dominos-transformed-into-an-ecommerce-powerhouse-whose-product-is-pizza/\"><strong><em>Forbes</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>It’s well known that Domino’s had both an image and a sales problem in the middle of the 00’s. The company’s stock price hit an all-time low in 2008, going for around $3.00 a share compared to today’s price of $211.</p><p>Around that time, Domino’s went through a complete overhaul of its ingredients, recipes, and menu. While they made vast improvements in product quality, what they did in terms of technology and e-commerce innovation was groundbreaking. With so many of today's enterprises talking about digital transformation, what Domino’s has done over the last decade during outgoing CEO J. Patrick Doyle’s tenure is a case study on how digital transformation leads to business value.</p><p>I sat down with Kelly Garcia, Domino’s SVP of eCommerce Development and Emerging Technologies, at CES earlier this month to discuss the company’s technological transformation. Here are a few takeaways from our conversation.</p><h3><strong>Three Key Ingredients of Domino’s Digital Transformation</strong></h3><ul> \t<li><strong>Organizational Buy-in From the Top Down was Critical</strong></li></ul><p>Knowing it would require a massive technology investment to deliver a world-class e-commerce experience, it was crucial that everyone at the top, from the Board of Directors to the CEO an on down, needed to be on board. In 2012, Kelly and Dennis Maloney, the Chief Digital Officer, went to the Board and outlined the threats to the business. They introduced the idea that to survive, they had to start thinking themselves as an “e-commerce company that happens to sell pizza.</p><p>” The CEO already believed in, and fully supported, this vision and once the Board was behind it as well, the technology plan was funded.</p><p>Along with gaining support from the top down, it was critical to develop a strong culture at the company. Early on they were selling the vision as a means of recruiting talent. As they began to see success, the culture became one of passion and excitement, with very little turnover. Kelly stressed how critical it was during this time for members the leadership team to be aligned as partners. Some organizations fail because of friction at the top setting a rocky example for the rest of the company.</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Relentless Dedication to Measuring Results</strong></li></ul><p>With the help of an outstanding analytics team, Domino’s was able to employ A/B testing against every new tool and process they implemented. Digital products, especially those based on ordering, by nature provide massive amounts of data. By understanding what was driving bottom-line results and sales, both across the board and by franchise, they were able to offset costs and prove value. This, in turn, enabled them to get more budget and funding to scale the areas that were working.</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Marketing Around Telling Customers about Technology Investment</strong></li></ul><p>With brand image being a crucial area in need of improving, Domino’s new unified, tech-forward vision was shared broadly across owned, earned, and paid channels. It was important for the brand to be transparent about both their need to change, as well as the huge investment they were making in their digital transformation. In addition to investing heavily in telling consumers about their new digital products, they built platforms like Think Oven, to maintain a two-way dialogue with them. According to Kelly, it was important from the start to promote a culture where the Marketing and IT teams were collaborative and strategically aligned.</p><h3><strong>Belief in the Process</strong></h3><p>According to Kelly, Domino’s success can be explained in two distinct phases. The first phase of their transformation was based on getting the fundamentals right. Knowing the industry was moving to mobile, the brand took a mobile-first approach. By building world-class native and iOS mobile clients, with a powerfully responsive experience, the Domino’s business model fundamentally shifted. Mobile contributed to half of their digital sales, with digital sales taking over the majority of sales. Mobile excellence, combined with A/B testing to find out what worked and developing robust consumer profiles, gave Domino’s a strong foundation on which to build.</p><p>The second major phase of the process was surprise and delight. The company implemented a strategy of enabling customers to order on their favorite devices, any way they want, anywhere. This was the beginning of their innovative ordering platform, Domino’s AnyWare. Today, customers can order through Apple TV, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Ford Sync, SMS, Samsung Smart TVs, smartwatches, an in-app voice assistant, and other emerging platforms, as well as via Tweets, Slack, and Facebook messenger. The platform diversity of their solution also enabled Domino’s to attract top talent to work on product development. The other side of the surprise and delight phase involved putting a loyalty program in place to reward Domino’s best customers and keep them away from the competition.</p><h3><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3><p>Asked what he’s most excited about from a technology perspective in 2018, Kelly highlighted voice interface and conversational commerce as a key area for continued growth. Viewing this as the next wave of mobile next mobile, he believes that conversational commerce is where the industry is moving in the next 3-5 years.</p><p>With all of the challenges a business faces in trying to make a digital transformation, perhaps the main lesson to be learned from Domino’s is that getting the fundamentals right first is of the utmost importance. It takes patience, but building that foundation, along with gaining buy-in from the entire organization, is necessary before moving on the the shiny new objects.</p><p>‍<strong><em>This article originally appeared in </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewong/2018/01/26/how-dominos-transformed-into-an-ecommerce-powerhouse-whose-product-is-pizza/\"><strong><em>Forbes</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><em>Kyle Wong is the founder and CEO of Pixlee, a UGC visual marketing platform.

    "content": "<p>Many social media managers are beginning to understand how TikTok works. But fashion brands have already begun to take the lead (along with cosmetics brands) in terms of TikTok content. TikTok's unique format and highly engaged user base combine to create an exciting new frontier for community engagement for fashion brands. Given the nuances of the channel, here are some unique and interesting ways fashion and apparel brands can rule <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/tiktok-statistics/\">TikTok.</a></p><h2><strong>1. Before and After Videos with Influencers or Customers</strong></h2><p>TikTok is a great channel for before and after transformation demos. Fashion brands are uniquely poised to take advantage of this with influencers and user-generated content. One popular example of this on TikTok that fashion brands already use is to cut a video in the middle to reveal a totally different look or style. Creating this content can be time-consuming, however, and TikTok users crave authentic and not-overly-produced content. Working with influencers or existing customers can bring a relatable or aspirational edge to your brand on TikTok, without losing the authentic vibe the channel necessitates.</p><h2><strong>2. Step-By-Step or Training Video </strong></h2><p>Showing how to style a look or specific outfit is another great way for fashion brands to connect on TikTok. Breaking down step-by-step instructions for achieving a specific style can give your followers the inspiration they need to create their own looks.</p><h2><strong>3. Create A Hashtag Challenge </strong></h2><p>Hashtag trends and challenges are very common with TikTok. Some of the best hashtag challenges have been encouraged by brands, even created by brands. Ralph Lauren launched a campaign on TikTok while the US Open was happening in August of 2019. They featured actress Diana Silver playing tennis and celebrating her wins with the native-type effect within TikTok’s native design. They encouraged other users to create their own similar videos using the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/winningrl?lang=en\">#WinningRL</a>, for a chance to win Ralph Lauren merchandise. This generated over 700 million views on the initial brand video and other videos created during the challenge.</p><h2><strong>4. Trendjack</strong></h2><p>On TikTok, trends can change very quickly. And there's nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/trendjacking-jumping-in-on-internet-culture-3-brands-doing-it-right/\" target=\"_blank\">well-done trendjacking</a>. But this can be a tricky area because not all trends should be capitalized on. This is one place where partnering with influencers can be helpful as their insight into trends on the channel and the audience you're trying to reach can help gauge how that trend will resonate.</p><h2><strong>5. Create a Virtual Event</strong></h2><p>As virtual events gain traction, fashion brands can host virtual fashion shows or event-like experiences with TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/tiktok-social-networking-video-app-gen-z-mac-ralph-lauren\" target=\"_blank\">As mentioned in Vogue</a>, &nbsp;“By letting users create their own videos for a challenge or campaign, brands give users a sense that they’re part of [a wider community],” explains Laura Perez, director of communications at TikTok. Building a virtual community around your brand has never been more tenable than right now.</p><p>TikTok is already a booming channel, and as digital engagement increases this year, it'll be important to at least understand how it can impact different brands.</p><p>‍<em>David is a professional writer and </em><a href=\"https://www.bestessays.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>essay writer</em></a><em> from Virginia.

Generative AI, thus, fulfills many of the needs of modern digital marketers.</p><p id=\"\">For example, when a company needs a new blog post written about a popular topic in its industry, rather than writing it from scratch, it may simply have a generative AI tool write the blog post or get an outline started by looking at similar articles and developing new insights.</p><p id=\"\">Generative AI is a milestone in <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-pixlee-powers-ugc-marketing-with-ai-and-machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">artificial intelligence development</a> because it can create new things rather than just replicate or recite things it has seen before.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2360px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2360px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63e56ffdc0ad9524ba867c19_Screen%20Shot%202023-02-09%20at%2010.59.05%20AM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Generative AI images created by Google AI (<a href=\"https://techmonitor.ai/technology/emerging-technology/generative-ai-google-meta-video\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI images created by Google AI</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=\"\">Generative AI vs. Machine Learning</h3><p id=\"\">While generative AI is similar to machine learning, the two concepts are not exactly the same.</p><p id=\"\">Machine learning is a method of training artificial intelligence tools and systems. Through machine learning, creators or users expose AI models to data. The more data the ML algorithm has to work with, the better the results it will hypothetically produce.</p><p id=\"\">AI tools use machine learning algorithms to train themselves on data sets, then make predictions, decisions, or content based on those data sets. Many generative AI tools may leverage machine learning as a way to provide themselves with the information they need to create high-quality, relevant content relative to their input parameters.</p><p id=\"\">For instance, if a company wants to use a generative AI tool to make a new blog post, it may provide that AI tool with similar blog posts for machine learning purposes.</p><p id=\"\">Machine learning can also be used for other AI tools, not just generative AI. In fact, many brands already use<a href=\"https://www.atlantic.net/vps-hosting/how-to-make-the-best-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cloud-computing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> machine learning for data analysis</a>, as AI in a centralized cloud can help them maximize their business intelligence and make better, data-driven decisions.</p><h2 id=\"\">Controversy Surrounding Generative AI</h2><p id=\"\">Businesses leveraging generative AI to create marketing content are <strong id=\"\">likely to face a variety of challenges that have never existed before</strong>. For example, controversy already exists around <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-generative-ai-is-changing-creative-work\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ownership and credit</a> for generative AI content. Some believe the creators of AI writing and art generators like Jasper should be credited for the original content the tool creates, while others argue that they shouldn’t, because the content created pulls from existing writing, artwork, and images that already exist online.</p><p id=\"\">Furthermore, some artists and content creators view Generative AI tools as an instrument to assist in sharpening and developing their creations, while others <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90816817/generative-ai-tools-are-rocking-creativity-the-way-napster-shook-up-music\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">express concerns</a> about potential competition between human creators and artificial intelligence.</p><p id=\"\">Only time will tell how controversial generative AI content will become in marketing and what barriers marketers will face when leveraging it, but it’s worth learning about how these tools can potentially impact businesses positively, as well. Let’s dive into these potential use cases.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Potential Applications of Generative AI</h2><p id=\"\">Generative AI already has several potential applications in marketing and other sectors. Here are some brief examples:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">In creative industries, generative AI may be used to make original works of art, like digital paintings or music. This can be advantageous for companies that need a lot of engaging content produced quickly.</li><li id=\"\">In product design industries, generative AI may help design completely new products by taking desired characteristics or attributes into account, then coming up with brand-new ideas or schematics that fit those desires/needs.</li><li id=\"\">In the <a href=\"https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">medical research industry</a>, generative AI can be used to come up with new ideas or hypotheses for future research projects.</li><li id=\"\">In the marketing and advertising arenas, generative AI may be helpful when generating new marketing campaigns and creating ads based on outcomes input by tool users.</li></ul><p id=\"\">In these ways and more, generative AI has the potential to cause major disruptions in a wide variety of industries. While some are worried about the upcoming changes, others are looking to take full advantage of these new tools.</p><h2 id=\"\">Marketing and the Importance of <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">User-Generated Content</a></h2><p id=\"\">Digital marketing is extremely important in today’s competitive landscape and can help boost sales in almost any industry. It is essential for<a href=\"https://www.waveapps.com/blog/what-is-an-llc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> small companies like LLCs</a> and sole proprietorships that typically have a limited budget and no recognizable brand yet. In fact, digital marketing represents the best and most cost-effective avenue for businesses to reach new customers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Digital marketing can include digital ads, like Google pay-per-click ads, social media advertisements, YouTube content, and UGC or user-generated content.</p><p id=\"\">UGC is brand-specific content created by a brand’s customers or users that is typically published on social media or other channels. It is an excellent way for companies to increase the authenticity of their marketing campaigns. For instance, imagine that your company sells a product to a satisfied customer. That customer opens up their TikTok profile gushing about the product. To further entice new buyers, your marketing team can use a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/social-ugc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">UGC platform</a> to collect that content and get permission to display that video and use it as a testimonial on your brand’s marketing channels.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2628px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2628px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63e57012355c6fc77253d316_crocs%20gallery.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Screenshot of Crocs customer photo gallery\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">These days, many consumers trust user-generated content, such as testimonials or <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a> content, over traditional advertisements, which are seen as inauthentic. That’s one reason why many brands now partner with influencers on <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/top-social-platforms-to-find-user-generated-content\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media platforms</a> like Facebook and Instagram. The best way to get new customers is to show how other people are already using your products or services - and enjoying them.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Will Generative AI Affect UGC, Influencers, and Digital Marketing?</h2><p id=\"\">Generative AI has the potential to seriously affect user-generated content and digital marketing as a whole. Here are a few ways in which generative AI could cause major waves in these areas.</p><h3 id=\"\">Display UGC Intelligently and Dynamically</h3><p id=\"\">Generative AI may be able to intelligently look at user-generated content, ranging from written content to videos to pictures and display that content intelligently and dynamically. Pixlee TurnTo leverages AI to help brands identify the most relevant and engaging pieces of UGC collected through the platform to ensure their best content is displayed in the right places.</p><p id=\"\">Taking this a step further, AI tools can look at the search or viewing history of a new visitor to your website. Upon analyzing that visiting history, the AI can then provide that unique visitor with a batch of user-generated content, like pictures of your products or testimonials that highlight specific things, most likely to result in a sale or a longer visit.</p><p id=\"\">At the same time, generative AI can take user-generated content already on your site or your database and adjust it for better, more dynamic display options. It can improve the lighting, change the position of objects or figures in photographs, and much more.</p><p id=\"\">All of this results in user-generated content that looks top-tier 24/7 without your <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/marketing-automation/articles/marketing-team/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">marketing team</a> putting in significantly more work. Your user-generated content may be much more effective when trying to bring new customers to your brand or trying to entice people to make a purchase.</p><h3 id=\"\">Customer Targeting</h3><p id=\"\">Note that AI tools, in general, will impact the marketing arena because of how they will allow brands to target customers more directly.</p><p id=\"\">AI is particularly good at sifting through large data sets and finding hidden patterns. Machine learning allows AI technology to target customers who are most likely to make a purchase or become attached to your brand based on things like demographics, visit history, and past purchases.</p><p id=\"\">Some AI tools can provide key information to marketing teams, such as:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Which demographics they should target</li><li id=\"\">What their next advertisements should focus on</li><li id=\"\">How to create new content that will resonate with target customers.</li><li id=\"\">Whether customers will accept higher prices or<a href=\"https://www.creditdonkey.com/credit-card-processing-fees.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> fees for your products</a>, such as credit cards, or new services</li></ul><p id=\"\">Customer targeting is already well-developed and comprehensive, but it will become even more robust and accurate with the further adoption of AI tools and generative AI algorithms.</p><h3 id=\"\">Large-Scale Content Creation</h3><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Most importantly, generative AI will impact marketing and UGC marketing campaigns, specifically through content creation.</strong></p><p id=\"\">These days, marketing teams have to create a wealth of content almost nonstop. Because social media and the internet are fast-moving, ever-changing landscapes, it’s not enough to produce one piece of content per week. For your brand to be competitive, you likely have to create several pieces of content each week, spread out between blog posts, social media posts, videos, etc.</p><p id=\"\">Making all of that content can be time-consuming and costly. For example, your brand may need to hire a lot of copywriters, digital designers, <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/youtube-vs-instagram-vs-tiktok-which-channel-is-best-for-cosmetics-brands\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">YouTube creators</a>, and influencers to make content your consumers will find useful and engaging.</p><p id=\"\">With generative AI, you can offload much of that work onto AI tools. In a matter of minutes, generative AI can produce intelligent, grammatically correct articles on key topics in your industry. While generative AI tools lack the sophistication of human writers for now, it’s only a matter of time before they become the most cost-effective means to fill up your website with informative and entertaining blog posts.</p><p id=\"\">However, <strong id=\"\">most companies and marketers agree that there will always be a need for authentic content created by real people</strong>, like UGC. While a computer-generated image or even a virtual influencer can create unique, engaging content for a brand to reshare, customers will always be looking for social proof from real people like them when determining whether or not to make a purchase. UGC, influencer content, and generative AI therefore have the power to work together, diversifying your marketing content while still humanizing your brand.</p><h3 id=\"\">Improves Personalization</h3><p id=\"\">By bolstering your data collection abilities, generative AI can help you make more money by producing marketing materials and web content that resonate more deeply with your target audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For example, using these tools, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34146/7-excellent-examples-of-email-personalization-in-action.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create highly personalized emails</a> and marketing messages according to each reader’s interests and send them at the exact time your readers are most likely to engage with them. You can also display only the most relevant website content based on each visitor’s online activity and location, which can help improve your conversion rates.</p><p id=\"\">It’s no stretch to say that generative AI may completely revolutionize the marketing industry in a few years. With increased personalization and content tailored to individual customers, brands may be able to collect even more data around conversion and how it relates to the content they share. It’s important to note that many UGC and influencer marketing platforms like Pixlee TurnTo already allow marketers to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/why-brands-should-leverage-user-generated-content-in-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">map specific pieces of content to revenue</a>, especially when that content is made shoppable on a brand’s ecommerce website.</p><h2 id=\"\">Is Generative AI at its Peak?</h2><p id=\"\">Not yet. Despite recent hubbub and news buzz, generative AI is far from perfect, and it still needs to be fine-tuned before it’s ready for widespread adoption. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether generative AI will be able to personalize content as ideally as is predicted once it is deployed in the wider market.</p><p id=\"\">That said, it’s clear that generative AI is already having a major impact on the marketing sector. If your brand doesn’t use generative AI or machine learning tools yet, you should actively seek out research and knowledge about how it might pertain to your company. It’s important to start looking into these tools and how to implement them into your marketing campaigns before your competitors take advantage of these new technologies.</p><p id=\"\">While there’s no doubt that generative AI will make an impact, it remains to be seen what that impact actually looks like. Time will tell whether tools like ChatGPT can achieve the dynamism and flexibility envisioned by their creators.</p><p id=\"\">In the meantime, Pixlee TurnTo already uses AI and machine learning technologies like image recognition to empower your brand and bolster your digital marketing campaigns.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/download/travel-marketing-guide-millennial-traveler\" target=\"_blank\">Millennials and Gen Z have forever changed travel – and the way that brands market destinations, hotels and related products.</a> From the role of technology and apps to the increasing value of brand influencers with peer-to-peer visual user generated content, new forces are shaping the industry.</p><p>Within tourism marketing, there’s a significant amount to learn and to experiment with new marketing techniques in order to connect with these traveler segments. What does Gen Z’s brand disloyalty mean for building relationships and long-term retention? How can marketers shape effective campaigns that are tech-savvy and visual enough to connect with Millennials, yet convey the authenticity that these travelers crave?Here’s a closer look at some of the biggest factors impacting travel marketing and how brands are responding.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Millennial Travel Trends vs. Gen Z: Not the Same Traveler</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Savvy brands are keying in on a critical differentiation point: there are distinct differences between Millennial and Generation Z travelers. Brands have to decide which group they’re targeting, or build these different preferences into their customer segmentations with unique campaigns for each group. Millennial travel and the generation’s overall habits are fairly well understood as they’ve become the most studied generation in history; yet many of those preferences are quickly evolving as Millennials shift to a different stage of life that may include partnership, marriage, kids and more.</p><p>At the same time, Gen Z is emerging as a segment with a potential $283 billion in buying power for international tourism – and they operate with distinctly different preferences. A <a href=\"https://skift.com/2016/08/11/gen-z-disloyalty-the-next-blue-ocean-for-travel-brands/\">Skift</a> trends report notes that this generation is still forming their loyalties (or may not form them at all), but getting in early is a blue ocean opportunity for travel marketers. Generation Z are mobile natives, constantly engaged with visual and livestreaming social media, and are still developing what they want out of their travel experience. Invest now in understanding what these customers want and develop user experiences and content marketing that speak directly to them to help solidify their brand loyalties for the long-term.</p><p>‍<strong>The Buyer’s Journey is Digital</strong>90% of Millennials and Gen Z book travel online. Travelers under the age of 35 hardly remember using an in-person travel agent, perhaps with the exception of the most complex or exotic trips. If a traveler is thinking about a beach vacation, they simply go online to look at different options, read travel guides and visitor reviews, and compare prices. As a result, travel marketers need an effective content marketing strategy that responds to the digital buyers journey that’s:</p><ul> \t<li><em>Informative:</em> Travelers are conducting research online and want strategic insights that speak directly to them. Generic guides aren’t enough. Travel content must speak to your target demographic.</li> \t<li><em>Visual:</em> Articles and written guides remain important. Yet today’s mobile and social users – especially Millennials and Gen Z – are more likely to be captivated by visual content. Travel marketers are developing their visual assets. There’s an increasing focus on video, images and finding ways to get influencers and travelers to share their experiences on social media and travel review sites.</li> \t<li><em>Authentic:</em> Authenticity means different things throughout the buyer’s experience. At one level, it means that travelers want the unvarnished truth about a destination. In part, they rely on influencers and other travelers’ reviews. They’re also looking for authenticity, more cultural connection and an ability to really experience a destination reflected in the marketing. Authenticity doesn’t mean a lack of luxury, necessarily; but the Millennial traveler and the Gen Z traveler want to walk away from a trip with an essence of a people and place through its food, music, and neighborhoods. Today’s most successful travel marketing conveys these possibilities in a way that feels honest and informative, without being salesy.</li></ul><p><strong>A Backpack Full of Apps: Technology in Travel Marketing</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Technology plays another critical role in the shifting landscape of travel marketing. As <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-09-25/how-millennials-are-traveling-better-than-you\">Conde Nast</a> notes, today’s Millennials are traveling with a “backpack full of apps.” Today’s guidebooks are visual, fit into your pocket via a smartphone, and are fully integrated with features like audio tours and Google maps. Destination marketing organizations and tour providers alike are finding ways to make it easier to navigate cities and countries. Becoming a trusted advisor and offering proprietary tools – or digital experiences during the marketing process – can be an important differentiator. For example, several destinations are working with filmmakers to create 360-degree virtual reality videos to use in their marketing and give Millennials and Gen Z travelers a taste of what’s in store at specific destinations.</p><p>‍<strong>Marketing Authenticity Through User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><a href=\"https://www.sabre.com/insights/what-stats-reveal-about-travel-behaviors-by-generation/\">Shullman</a> found that 77% of Millennials travel for pleasure. However, they’re looking for authenticity in both destinations and marketing. As a result, marketing is shifting from the polished, staged photo shoots to influencer marketing and leveraging user generated content that captures authentic experiences through a relatable lens and voice. For example, a marketing campaign for tours of Paris no longer focuses on the iconic shots of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame.</p><p>Millennials and Gen Z want to know where Parisians spend time, the best secret locations to get a great meal, and off-beat historic sites that others in their age group feel are not to be missed. Travel marketers with clear strategies for developing positive, helping user generated content – whether through their own customer base or strategic partnerships with influencers – are effectively addressing this need.</p><p>Travel marketers have to keep one eye on the current landscape and one eye on the future. Marketing to Millennials and Gen Z requires a strategy that’s built around strong images, helpful content, a multi-channel approach and an authentic voice for each generation. Investing now in the partnerships and tools – from content creation platforms to the analytics to know what’s working – is the foundation for a strong ROI when marketing to Millennials and Gen Z alike.</p>",

    "content": "<p>By 2020, Millennials will make up a total of 50% of the workforce and will control roughly $400 billion in spending power. This change marks a large shift in purchasing power as Millennials become the majority of the consumer market. Millennials, unlike any other generation that has come before them, have embraced social media. In fact, Millennials and social media have become almost synonymous with one another. Because of this, social media has progressed beyond social networking. It has become a wide set of platforms that are relied upon for news, activism, humor and, of course, marketing and advertising. With the rise of social media, brands have started to utilize its channels to reach and resonate with Millennial customers and to tap into their large purchasing power.</p><p>Research on “Millennial characteristics” when it comes to purchasing decisions is prevalent. Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are the generation born between 1980 and 2000. Some say that they are fickle and at times inattentive to the world around them, but upon closer examination Millennials have been found to be extremely deliberate with their choices. This is most noticeable in what and how they buy. When it comes to purchase decisions, there are four classic core values that Millennials seek out: <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/product\" target=\"_blank\">authenticity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/benefits/create-brand-loyalty\" target=\"_blank\">trust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/benefits/improve-brand-engagement\" target=\"_blank\">involvement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/benefits/generate-brand-awareness\" target=\"_blank\">validation</a>. Social media marketing is especially effective for resonating with Millennial buyers and these specific values. Social networks provide the perfect confluence of the four if done correctly: the content shared on social media is authentic, it is created by friends and peers, and it can be used in relevant and valuable ways.<strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong> </p><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sujanpatel/2015/06/24/how-businesses-should-be-using-social-media-in-2015/#1cd429df4a5b\">73% of the U.S.</a> population has some sort of a social media profile. This is a large pool of consumers that brands could be targeting. Different social media channels allows companies to individually tailor content and campaigns to reach a very targeted demographic. Savvy digital marketers understand that the social media platforms that you market on should reflect the target demographic of your brand. Social media marketing allows companies to exemplify values that Millennials hold dear such as authenticity and social validation. They also open up the possibility for direct conversations between the brand and its customers. As a result, brands today are allocating more of their marketing budgets to social media to find and engage new customers. While most brands focus on creating content for social media, increasing their followings, and building levels of engagement-- there is more than marketers can do to leverage social media to attract Millennial customers.</p><p>One of the best ways for brands to understand and <a href=\"https://blog.pixlee.com/3-tips-for-marketing-to-millennials\" target=\"_blank\">market to millennials</a> is by tapping into the power of user-generated content. In today’s digital age, marketers no longer get to tell consumers what their brand stands for, consumers tell each other what the brand stands for. How can marketers leverage digital word of mouth to attract and connect with Millennial customers? User-generated content serves as the most trusted form of product <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2014/04/09/millennials-user-generated-media/#SEkxP7uKpgqL\">reviews currently available.</a> Social media users create an insane amount of user-generated content—over 2 billion photos are posted and shared every day online. This customer-created content often features the brands, products, and places that they love. These photos are visual endorsements that serve as 5-star ratings of the brands that they buy from. Some marketers have started to put user-generated content to use, curating a digital story from the mass of photos and videos that their customers share. By doing so, marketers are building a trustworthy avenue that shows their products’ real world usability and inspires potential customers to buy.</p><p>In 2017, U.S. Millennials will spend over 200 billion dollars in the consumer markets. That’s roughly a third of the yearly consumer market expectation. They will spend across different venders and for very different reasons. What’s important to takeaway is that more than 50% of Millennials make an extra effort to buy from companies who they believe represent their values: validation, trust, authenticity and a sense of involvement. To maximize this opportunity, brands should partner with Millennial content creators and expand the reach of this content by being active on social media. In order to do this, brands will need to engage enthusiastic customers and leverage user-generated content to reach more customers and validate their products.</p>",

    "content": "<p>National Geographic is one of the top Instagram accounts online today with more than 61.4 million followers, and it's easy to see why with its access to gorgeous global imagery and the world's top photo-explorers. Yet it is using its highly engaged follower base to create innovative and visually stunning content with interactive, successful social media marketing campaigns such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wanderlustcontest/\">Wanderlust</a>.</p><p>Wanderlust is a campaign that invites amateur photographers to submit their best travel photos – and to date, there are more than 55,000 photos on Instagram with the #wanderlustcontest hashstag. It’s a powerful example of how the organization has perfected engagement strategies that lead to effective user generated content campaigns. Here’s a closer look at why brands should consider user generated content campaigns for Instagram and what they can learn from National Geographic’s example of a successful<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\"> social media contest</a>.</p><p>‍<strong>How Travel Marketers are Leveraging User-Generated Content:</strong>For travel marketers wondering how to make a successful social media campaign, look no further than user generated content. According to the <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/travel-user-generated-content-a-goldmine-hiding-in-plain-sight-infographic/623195\">Social Times</a>, user generated campaigns are an untapped goldmine for travel brands. 52% of travelers use online photos to research destinations and plan trips. The majority of travelers have a camera in their pocket via their smartphones, and are often shooting video and images to share with friends, load on social media or include in travel reviews later. The success of potential user generated campaigns is showcased by Wanderlust’s general success: it received extensive publicity and tens of thousands of photos now bear the hashtag.</p><p>For travel brands that are looking for a creative alternative to marketing shots that can feel too staged and polished in today’s organic, fast-moving and authentic online context, user generated content campaigns can help. It takes advantage of present and engaged tourists, generates visual content for accounts and provides a natural intersection with what travel brands have to offer.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:942px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"942px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283baec776d183d6480d46d_Wanderlust-social-campaign-example.png\" alt=\"Wanderlust-social-campaign-example.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong>What Can Brands Learn from National Geographic's Approach? </strong><em>‍</em></p><p><em>Simplify participation:</em> National Geographic kept the general participation guidelines simple. Users with a public Instagram account who resided in the U.S. could participate in Wanderlust by uploading the shot and including the campaign hashtag in their comments. The most successful social media campaigns don’t let complex rules become a barrier to entry. Ensure that you have the appropriate guidelines in place to prevent misuse and protect your brand – and from there, make it easy to take part in the competition.</p><p>‍<em>Strike the right media mix:</em> National Geographic’s user generated content campaigns were successful because it was just one part of their overall channel strategy. The Instagram account publishes original, high quality images. They also host annual photography competitions that are dominated by experts, and segment campaigns targeted at young photographers. Wanderlust is a deliberate effort to target an amateur audience and embraces a wide range of skill levels and contributions. Incorporating the right messaging – about sharing the world through your lens, for example - is more likely to engage the average traveler and get them excited about making a contribution.</p><p>‍<em>Don’t be too restrictive:</em> Travelers find inspiration in a wide range of places. One photographer might be captivated by beach scenes, while others enjoy the vibrancy and colors of a market on a busy day. Each contribution will speak to a different part of your audience. While it’s fine to provide guidelines, suggestions or even categories, a user generated content campaign should have an inclusive theme. For example, a campaign for Hawaii might consider asking for something like “Show us the image that best captures your favorite Hawaiian island” or “What was the most beautiful moment of your trip?”<em>Reward participation:</em> Contests often have a grand prize, whether it’s a free item, a monetary prize, or simply an award. However, there are other easy ways to thank participants for sharing content. Like and comment on each photo that’s submitted. Share outstanding submissions so that your photographers get additional exposure and feel appreciated. One option that many brands miss is the chance to use their platform to reward participation through simple engagement and sharing.</p><p>As brands rush to find ways to incorporate visual content into their marketing mix, travel marketers have an advantage. Whether it's a photo of relaxing by the pool or exploring a mountain peak, images of destinations, hotels and events speak to the target user and provide strong successful social media marketing campaign examples. National Geographic's campaigns - especially Wanderlust - provide a great example of strategies of how to amplify your reach and use it as an opportunity to engage with followers. If you’re wondering how to create a successful social media marketing campaign that really engages viewers, study National Geographic’s work across platforms for world-class inspiration.</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Product ratings and reviews are a critical feature for any ecommerce or brand website. Not only do reviews help foster trust in consumers, ratings and reviews can have a powerful impact on SEO. Because of this, increasing the quality and length of reviews should be critical goals for ecommerce brands and retailers alike. Here’s when syndicated reviews come to the picture. <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/syndication-for-brands/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Review Syndication for Brands</a> allows brands to feed their own products’ reviews onto retailers’ websites to generate more sales. <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/syndication-for-retailers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Syndication for Retailers</a> enables retailers to source and publish these organic reviews from individual brand websites. This process produces a mutually-beneficial relationship that can reap great rewards for SEO performance and ecommerce success. But understanding the technical requirements to properly syndicate reviews and ensure SEO best practices are adhered to is critical. </p><h2 id=\"\">Popular Search Terms in Syndicated Reviews Drive Traffic</h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">“Long-tail keywords”</a> are specific, and typically longer keyword phrases that consumers use when they’re near the end of their online shopping journey and closer to purchase. This could mean something like “waterproof lightweight two-tone windbreaker” as opposed to “outerwear” for an apparel brand. Leveraging the product-specific keywords your customers use in their reviews will make your site more accessible to consumers searching those unique phrases.</p><p id=\"\">TurnTo is a Google-certified review aggregator, meaning brands and retailers can also syndicate their product reviews to Google for use in <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/product_listing_ads_intro.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">product listing ads</a> and Google shopping. This massive improvement to review accessibility means the keywords consumers are searching for will show up right at the top of their Google search engine results page (SERP). &nbsp;Especially for smaller brands that may not gather many native reviews, if at all, syndicated reviews can be especially valuable when competing with larger brands or retailers in your industry. This is because they provide you with those brand and product-specific keywords that shoppers are already searching for, resulting in a higher search result ranking.</p><p id=\"\">Because reviews are a form of user-generated content, they can <a href=\"https://www.seoquake.com/blog/google-user-generated-conten/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">boost domain authority</a> and SEO by increasing engagement and page traffic, as well as reducing the bounce rate.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2724px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2724px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea0549f92580922ae7b16_Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.40.27-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Sun &amp; Ski Sports sells products from hundreds of brands, using TurnTo Review Syndication for Retailers to make sure as many products as possible, like this cooler from YETI, feature reviews originally posted on the brand’s site.</p><h2 id=\"\">Syndicated Reviews Help Increase Conversion</h2><p id=\"\">Syndicated reviews <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/how-product-ratings-drive-ecommerce-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">increase conversion rate</a>, generating more revenue for your ecommerce company. Reviews act as compelling social proof that a product is worth buying, removing the uncertainty that often holds buyers back from completing a purchase. According to our proprietary data, the first five reviews a product receives have the potential to lift sales by an <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/why-getting-more-reviews-faster-should-be-your-number-one-ecommerce-goal/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">average of 9.5%</a>.</p><p id=\"\">While the first 30 reviews on a product page can <a href=\"https://www.fera.ai/blog/posts/online-product-review-statistics-ecommerce-stores-need-them\" id=\"\">increase conversion by 25%</a>, showing 100 reviews increases conversion by 37% or more, compared to having no reviews. TurnTo’s data shows it’s valuable to <a href=\"https://www.turntonetworks.com/blog/why-getting-more-reviews-faster-should-be-your-number-one-ecommerce-goal/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">collect more reviews as quickly as possible</a> to generate ecommerce success.This comes as no surprise to those of us familiar with online shopping; if you’re choosing between a 5-star product with 2 reviews and a 4.5-star product with 300 reviews, you’re more likely to choose the latter. If 300 people have been content with their purchase, there’s much less risk involved when buying it. This is due to the concept of <a href=\"https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/social-proof/\" id=\"\">social proof</a>; when we see other people sharing their experience purchasing and using a product, we’re more likely to match that behavior. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/627ea054b4fa11106a15cdb9_image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Staples uses TurnTo review syndication to source reviews from brand websites like Hewlett-Packard’s.</p><p id=\"\">Consumers who read reviews as well as FAQ sections with customer questions and answers like TurnTo’s Community Q&amp;A are <a href=\"https://www.annexcloud.com/blog/5-ways-customer-ratings-reviews-can-drive-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">105% more likely</a> to make a purchase on an ecommerce site. Globally renowned ecommerce websites have more customers, so it’s easier for them to source reviews and reap this conversion benefit. Smaller sites don’t always have this luxury without syndicating reviews. </p><h2 id=\"\">Inconsistent Reviews Across Sites Dissuade Buyers</h2><p id=\"\">Inconsistent, inaccurate, and outdated reviews have the potential to damage your brand’s reputation for shoppers viewing your product across different retailer’s websites. Similarly, online shoppers are less likely to trust retailers whose product feedback doesn’t align with the sentiment they may see on the brand’s own website. <a href=\"https://www.contentserv.com/en/blog/enable-product-content-syndication-to-e-commerce-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Contenserv explains</a> that shoppers are much more diligent today in their search to find answers and information about the products they’re interested in because of the resources available to them — most prominently, ratings and reviews. This means that while the chance of a shopper seeing inconsistent reviews across websites is elevated, as they’re probably searching for authentic product information to increase their purchase confidence. Your ecommerce website is less likely to rank highly when it’s lacking some or all of the product reviews posted on other websites that can positively influence SEO when listed correctly.</p><h2 id=\"\">Correctly Syndicated Reviews Aren’t Duplicate Content</h2><p id=\"\">Additionally, inconsistent product page content across brands and retailers is more likely to bring your ranking down in Google; the search engine powerhouse explains that correctly syndicated content with appropriate backlinks <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/duplicate-content?hl=en&ref_topic=4617741&visit_id=637705272534559363-1615438565&rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">improves how your site ranks</a> without appearing as duplicate content.</p><p id=\"\">TurnTo follows industry best practices to ensure that you continue to get the primary SEO credit for reviews you collect and publish. These include displaying source labels alongside the content, delaying delivery to syndication recipients, and managing the review display order on recipient sites. This means syndicated reviews are not considered duplicate content by Google because they have an explicit tag labeling a review “originally posted at x website.”​​</p><p id=\"\">TurnTo’s star ratings on organic and syndicated reviews are also fully indexable by search engines. That lets an average star rating for a product on your website show up right on the search engine results page, which can <a href=\"https://cxl.com/research-study/review-stars-google-help-click-rate-study/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">increase CTR by 35%</a>.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://loganix.com/seo-packages/\" target=\"_blank\">Improving SEO</a> and increasing review volume are goals many ecommerce marketers strive for when attempting to syndicate reviews manually, or not syndicating and focusing solely on platform-specific reviews. For brands and retailers of all sizes selling the same product online, automating the review syndication process is a step towards both a higher conversion rate and a higher Google ranking.</p>",

Financial advice can be a tricky subject, as qualified advisors go through years of training and often charge high rates. It’s easy to see how working with untrained online personalities could be a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Yet, over the last few years, financial topics like budget management and debt have become bigger talking points on social media. So has investment, with hashtags like #stocktok and #crypto garnering over 5 billion views on TikTok.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Who Is a Finfluencer?</h2><p id=\"\">New financial influencers (or “finfluencers”) have grown in popularity along with trending topics like cryptocurrency. The term covers any influencer whose main topic is money management. That includes those talking about managing personal finances, as well as investment-focused influencers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This has become such a popular source of financial information that the North American Securities Administration Association (<a href=\"https://www.nasaa.org/64940/informed-investor-advisory-finfluencers/?qoid=investor-advisories\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">NASAA</a>) has come up with its own definition of finfluencers:</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“A finfluencer is a person who, by virtue of their popular or cultural status, has the capability to influence the financial decision-making process of others through promotions or recommendations on social media”</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">Why Are Finfluencers Growing in Popularity?</h2><p id=\"\">Finance influencers have grown across social media platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram. Some have managed to attract millions of followers. They’ve built up an engaged audience of social users, typically under 40 years old, the same way that brands often do.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1000px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1000px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63b5e8253ffb23448d02dae0_image3%20(10).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://truelist.co/blog/generation-z-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Image Sourced</a> from truelist.co</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Financial information and product details can be a lot to digest. Influencers tend to relate these products to personal stories and experiences that their followers can relate to and understand. These finfluencers are essentially showing their community members that money management can solve specific goals and doesn’t have to be as daunting as it may seem. After all, everyone has to <a href=\"https://hobowithalaptop.com/i-need-money-fast\" target=\"_blank\">manage their personal finances</a> to some extent.</p><h3 id=\"\">Gen-z and Millennial Investors</h3><p id=\"\">As the millennial and Gen Z audiences mature, their spending power as investors is growing. At the same time, economic pressures mean that money management and finance are now <a href=\"https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/younger-generations-turn-to-social-media-for-financial-advice\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">important topics for this audience</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The fact is that these groups get their product advice from social media, and they may prefer to follow personalities rather than brands or finance companies. So, you can see why financial services should be considering <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/instagram-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a> as part of their digital strategy.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Trust and Public Accountability</h3><p id=\"\">As social media use has grown, so has the potential for scams and fraud. Social media was listed as the initial form of contact for <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/01/social-media-gold-mine-scammers-2021#footnote1\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">27%</a> of fraud reports in 2021. This has left users who rely on social media looking for verified and trusted sources of financial information.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But this hasn’t slowed the growth of financial influencers. In fact, it seems to have accelerated the success of finfluencers with a large following and a track record of good advice. Social signals have proven to be a strong influence on younger audiences’ trust.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have an investment in keeping scammers off their apps, too. Their reputations depend on accountability and authenticity, so algorithms and verification methods are developing all the time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Can Finfluencers Give Reliable Financial Advice?</h2><p id=\"\">At this point, you may be questioning whether or not social media influencers know what they’re talking about when it comes to finance. Aren’t there laws about who can give financial advice? Well, yes. Influencers generally aren’t qualified financial advisors, so they can’t give financial advice, but there are some ways around this.</p><h3 id=\"\">Education, Not Advice</h3><p id=\"\">The legal definition of financial advice is pretty specific. So, not everything you might think of as advice actually qualifies. An influencer talking about a financial product or giving information about investments is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In fact, some popular influencers like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/milansinghhh/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Milan Singh</a> have built their brand around the principle of “Education, not advice.” The idea is to help their audience pick up financial skills that they might not otherwise encounter. This is perfect for financial services marketers. It works well if, for example, you want to educate your customer about the HMRC transition to handling tax digitally. By providing an accessible guide for your clients on <a href=\"https://www.sage.com/en-gb/making-tax-digital/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">making tax digital software</a> you can convey more information than a standard ad and get closer to your audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Overall, finfluencers can be used as a stepping stone to drive your customer down the funnel. If they’re getting the basics and general advice from the creators they follow online, they’re likely to also trust those influencers’ recommendations for financial services, products, and companies.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Rising Finfluencers of TikTok and Instagram</h2><p id=\"\">With the popularity of financial influencers on the rise, there are a lot of these creators. They’re&nbsp; spread across different social media sites, too. TikTok and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/instagram-post-ideas-for-brands\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram</a> have been two of the most successful avenues for finfluencers.

Digital banks including Klarna and Moneybox have explored partnering with TikTok content creators, and others are following suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Creative digital marketing initiatives like Plum’s “<a href=\"https://help.withplum.com/en/articles/4002988-the-52-week-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">52-week saving challenge</a>” can generate significant engagement. Working with influencers who are well-known on the platform means you can lean on their knowledge of their audience to create relatable content.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Customer Education</h3><p id=\"\">Explaining a financial product to a customer is difficult at the best of times. Most people will get distracted or confused after a couple of minutes. That’s why working with influencers who can make products, apps, and investment options relatable is a valuable tool for customer education.</p><p id=\"\">For example, it can be incredibly useful if you’re looking to explain <a href=\"https://www.sage.com/en-gb/sage-business-cloud/accounting/features/self-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">self assessment tax return software</a> to your audience in a concise and easy to understand way. You can break down a complicated topic into easily digestible chunks, educating your clients about things that are important for them to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Social Media Presence</h3><p id=\"\">Working with finance influencers lets you expand your brand awareness without significantly ramping up your advertising spending. While you’ll have expenditure on sponsorships or affiliate revenue, it’s comparatively little even compared to social media ad placement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Digital marketers working with finance products aren’t limited to financial influencers, either. If the tone and values of an influencer match your brand, then you can reach wider audiences by partnering with influencers in the social space, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Remember Milan Singh, the influencer we mentioned earlier? <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@milansinghhh/video/7132553815672294699?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">This #ad for Credit Karma</a> attracted 1.7 million views from his followers.

    "content": "<p>With the increasing popularity of social influencers, there’s no denying that <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/engaging-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a> is a great way for brands to enhance their marketing efforts. This is exactly why many brands have chosen to work with social influencers to promote a new product. Leveraging influencers is &nbsp;highly effective; <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html\">92% of consumers</a> say that recommendations from individuals considered to be their peers are more trustworthy than any other form of advertising. &nbsp;</p><p>In order to introduce your new product to customers, work with influencers to boost your marketing reach and to establish trust.Take a look at some of these effective influencer marketing methods to boost your product launch:</p><p>‍<strong>1. Get Influencers Talking About your Brand: &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Influencers have a large reach and a loyal following. They have built this following based on detailing their lifestyles through superior digital storytelling. These followers observe the trends that influencers promote and often try the products that the influencer suggests. Encouraging influencers to talk about your new product on social media is a simple yet effective way to get started with your product launch. Find your brand influencers, &nbsp;reach out, and establish a relevant hashtag that the influencer can use to promote your product.</p><p>This technique has worked fairly well for LaCroix sparkling water. Using the hashtag #LiveLaCroix, the brand has encouraged influential individuals to talk about their new water flavors. Even celebrities like Big Smo have posted images of themselves enjoying LaCroix's new flavors.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:927px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"927px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283baac89a9ebe7a3eb2afa_big-smo-lacroix.png\" alt=\"big-smo-lacroix.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>They didn’t just limit themselves to people, but also opted to work with other \"influencers\" on Instagram. LaCroix promoted itself with animal Instagram influencers such as Tinkerbelle the dog.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:939px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"939px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bb24bff4665becc09d4d_tinkerbelle-la-croix.png\" alt=\"tinkerbelle-la-croix.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>While LaCroix didn't mind getting silly with celebrity and pup influencers, the driving forces behind LaCroix's social media marketing campaign were fitness influencers. Health and Fitness Instagrammers posted photos of themselves enjoying the new flavors and wrote descriptive captions inviting followers to try the drinks as well.</p><p><strong>2. Choose Relevant Influencers to Work With: </strong> </p><p>Social media influencers have a special knack for describing something in an appealing way that resonates with their audience. Whether it’s a trip to a distant city or a new line of clothing, they are able to paint an interesting digital story that encourages browsers to mimic their lifestyle decisions. So when it comes to educating your target audience about your new product, choose influencers that reflect the demographics and lifestyle of your brand.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Charlotte Russe to descirbe this technique. &nbsp;</p><p>Since the brand is about fast fashion and on-trend pieces, they partnered with micro-influencers sharing their fashionable outfit of the day. The brand engages online shoppers by displaying a shoppable, social inspiration gallery on its site. To collect hot customer content, Charlotte Russe asks customers to post their best looks on Instagram and to tag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charlotterusse/\">@CharlotteRusse</a> or <a href=\"https://www.charlotterusse.com/social-gallery.html\">#CharlotteLook</a> to be featured on its website's inspiration gallery. By displaying a shoppable inspiration gallery on its site, Charlotte Russe is able to inspire consumers with trendy looks, engage on social media while also increasing conversions online.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:825px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"825px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283baf9504edd225764e62d_charlottelook2.gif\" alt=\"charlottelook2.gif\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong>Promote Social Media Contests and Giveaways: </strong>Another excellent way to promote your new product is by hosting a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\">social media contest</a>. And what better way to promote the giveaway than through influencers? Hosting a giveaway isn’t enough if you don’t have enough fans signing up for it. So you need to get the news to people who will be interested in it and spread the news through influencers they look up to.</p><p>Ultimate Ears, a brand committed to transforming the way people experience music recently ran its #<a href=\"https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/theueboat\">TakeMeToTheUEBoat</a> social contest. Ultimate Ears asked contestants to share a photo of how they best celebrate summer and the winners received a free trip to Yacht Week in Europe. Ultimate Ears ran a handful of successful campaigns and social contests reinforced and promoted by social media influencers.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.25%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VVCAUpH3F8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><p><strong>Give Exclusive Access to Generate Buzz: &nbsp;</strong>When launching a new product, generating buzz way ahead of the launch date can be an excellent way to get your expected results after launch. Influencers can help you do this but you’ll need to give them exclusive access to the product before anyone else. Whether you give them early access to your product or you get them in on the creation process, it’s a great way to create awareness about the new product.</p><p>This is exactly what Chanel did before the launch of their new perfume – Chanel No. 5 L’Eau. They invited some of the biggest influencers in the fashion industry such as Instagrammers and fashion bloggers for a sneak peek into how Chanel makes their iconic perfumes in their production facilities in Grasse.</p><p>These Instagram influencers then posted several images of their visit using the unique hashtag #newchanel5 and #chanelgrasse. This encouraged followers to generate content of their own using the branded tag. One of their invitees was the Chinese cello prodigy Nana Ouyang, who posted an Instagram video of her visit, which generated more than 140,000 views.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:908px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"908px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bb230c9b535718c1589b_nana-ouyang-chanel.png\" alt=\"nana-ouyang-chanel.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>When choosing a new face for the perfume, they went with Lily Rose Depp who has massive influence and appeals to their target audience without being too mainstream. Her post with the #newchanel5 hashtag received more than 200,000 likes.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:944px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"944px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6283bb23aa82d10734dbc7d8_lily-depp.png\" alt=\"lily-depp.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Now you have a few ideas that can help you make the most of influencer marketing to launch your new product. Make sure you work with influencers who are relevant to your product and target your ideal audience while matching your brand values and lifestyle. You don’t have to limit yourself to just these examples; try to come up with a campaign that’s exclusive to your brand.

From social proof to load speed time, let’s walk through the areas of the PDP you should be focusing on.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Design the Best Ecommerce PDP</h1><h3 id=\"\">1. Add Social Proof Via <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">User-Generated Content</a> (UGC)</h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">92%</a> of shoppers trust user-generated content over traditional advertising methods.</li><li id=\"\">UGC is 35% more memorable than other media, and 50% more trusted.</li><li id=\"\">41% of consumers only need to see 1 to 4 UGC reviews to be influenced to buy.</li></ul><p id=\"\">UGC helps your brand establish customer loyalty and grow a community of passionate fans, while increasing conversion. This is because purchase decisions are based on trust, and site visitors are more likely to trust the authentic media shared by real people rather than manufactured by a brand or design studio.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c60a99c2cd0e0bd2f29f27_puma%20pdp%20graphic.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Puma uses Pixlee TurnTo’s <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/social-ugc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social UGC</a> solution to automatically collect (from social media and direct upload), publish, and analyze success metrics of community content originally posted on social media. The brand then showcases top content from members of its customer base directly on the product page to help site visitors contextualize their products by viewing them in-action.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">By showing your PDP visitors that other people like them love your product, you’re increasing their purchase confidence and showing off brand affinity. If you love this idea, you can take on a similar approach with your <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a> strategy, featuring influencer content on your product pages.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Facilitate Omnichannel Experiences</h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Companies with omnichannel engagement strategies retain 89% of their customers on average.</li><li id=\"\">Marketers who use three or more channels for one campaign observed a 287% higher purchase rate than the ones using a single-channel campaign.&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Omnichannel marketing campaigns offer 250% higher purchase frequency than single-channel campaigns.</li></ul><p id=\"\">So where does the PDP fit into <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/omnichannel-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">omnichannel marketing</a>? In addition to keeping your ecommerce team and social media team on the same page when it comes to design, language, tone, and values, the PDP is another place to feature content from your brand’s different channels. In addition to including Instagram content (your brand’s, your customers’, and/or your employees’) on product pages, try adding in TikTok content like Revel Nail does on its product pages.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c60aa48d81ccf9fbd11ee5_revel%20tiktok%20on%20pdp.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Revel Nail features both community and brand TikToks on its product pages using Pixlee TurnTo. Beyond the PDP, Pixlee TurnTo also allows you to make TikTok galleries shoppable across your website.</p><p id=\"\">Social media isn’t the only way to incorporate omnichannel marketing onto your PDP. Get creative! For example, this page can also be a place to garner email subscribers, especially if you tout a discount on the product they’re viewing. The omnichannel experience is beneficial to your brand and consumers because it offers more opportunities for product discovery and purchase, lends itself to better data, and improves customer retention and revenue.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Optimize Page Load Speed</h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">47%</a> of visitors expect a web page to load within two seconds.&nbsp; \t</li><li id=\"\">40% of visitors abandon a website that takes over 3 seconds to load.&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">A one-second delay in loading the page can lead to a <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">7%</a> lower conversion rate.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">In addition to using lightweight widgets, JPG or WEBP formats are best for images while PNG format is superior for images with illustrations, logos, texts, signs, and icons. &nbsp; Practice using fewer operators and declarations in your code, and never use CSS in HTML such as DIV and H1 tags.</p><p id=\"\">Make sure the assets on your page are not bulky and slowing down your PDP’s load speed. Additionally, assess content above the fold on your PDP — that’s what your shopper will see first, and should be loading first. However, remember the qualitative value of the images on your site. </p><p id=\"\">Don’t hyper-focus on sacrificing quality for speed.

Your brand team may even learn something from their answers!</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Offer Shoppers Multiple Payment Methods</h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Conversion rates increase by up to 30% when you add multiple payment methods.</li><li id=\"\">Customers make <a href=\"https://www.creditcards.com/statistics/payment-method-statistics-1276/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">28%</a> of their payments with debit cards.

Utilizing a “Buy Now, Pay Later” option may also result in more purchases if advertised on the product page. Delayed payment options may even increase average order value due to the flexibility they provide.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Consider Supplementing Reviews With <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/reviews/checkout-comments\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Checkout Comments™</a></h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/customer-reviews-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">95%</a> of customers read reviews before making a purchase.</li><li id=\"\">Positive customer reviews increase conversions by up to 270%.</li><li id=\"\">82% of shoppers search for negative reviews.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Any marketer or ecommerce expert knows that <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/ratings-and-reviews\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ratings &amp; reviews</a> are crucial to the layout of the product page (and if you didn’t, now you do!). However, there are times that a product may not receive any reviews, often because it’s relatively new.

Asking buyers of your product “Why did you buy this?” immediately after purchase promotes fast, honest, and clear responses. Your brand’s team no longer has to wait weeks for reviews to roll in after products are finally delivered and utilized, and Checkout Comments™ produce 3-5x more customer content than typical reviews. These shouldn’t be used as a replacement for reviews, but they can help your site visitors feel more comfortable making a purchase if they see others like them did as well.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:582px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"582px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62a0e219de6c29d469f561c3_shoecombo.PNG\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Tilly’s uses Checkout Comments on a wide variety of products to help shoppers get a sense of its customer community and their motivations.</p><h3 id=\"\">7.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Supply chains have taken quite a beating over the last few years, and no one has felt that more than the consumer.</p><p id=\"\">When it comes to ecommerce, customer expectations of fast turnaround times and infinite supply have caused serious challenges for small businesses. Larger companies like Amazon now provide one-day or even same-day shipping, a development that’s unrealistic for most direct-to-consumer brands.</p><p id=\"\">In fact, as a business with any kind of supply pipeline, relying on external shipping and distribution on both sides of the inventory cycle can leave you exposed to a litany of issues.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Sadly, with your brand name on the package, the negative outcome of shipping or supply chain issues often falls squarely at the doors of ecommerce professionals and marketers. Nowhere is that more visible to prospective customers than in the resultant negative reviews.</p><p id=\"\">However, even if the customer experience has hit the negative review stage, all is not lost.</p><p id=\"\">Let’s look at some damage control methods that can help you preserve buyer relationships and even offer an opportunity to improve them!</p><h2 id=\"\">Don’t Delay or Hide Reviews</h2><p id=\"\">Negative sentiment as a result of shipping and supply chain issues can often come down to fulfillment not taking place within an agreed timeframe. Therefore, failing to get ahead of or respond to negative feedback promptly is the worst possible thing you can do.</p><p id=\"\">When you drag your heels, you prove the customer right and reinforce the notion already in their minds that you’re working to no one’s schedule but your own. In a world where same-day drone drops are right around the corner, any dent in your supply chain armor is a wound that quickly needs to be addressed.</p><p id=\"\">Many of the <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/reviews/ratings-and-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">Ratings &amp; Reviews</a> platforms like Pixlee TurnTo provide a means by which you can have negative sentiment flagged immediately to help you to address the issue quickly. Having your response accompany a review shows online shoppers that your customer service team is dedicated to its customers and any issues they face.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, tools like <a href=\"https://www.dialpad.com/features/virtual-receptionist/\" target=\"_blank\">Dialpad's virtual receptionist service</a> that direct customers toward the right department for resolution should be more efficient and timely than ever.</p><p id=\"\">Some brands consider hiding negative reviews or removing Ratings &amp; Reviews completely from their websites <em id=\"\">because</em> most of their reviews are negative/1-star due to shipping/supply chain issues. However, this negative feedback has nothing to do with the product itself, and removing negative reviews due to low ratings violates FTC requirements, as this practice creates a false representation of customer experiences with a company. There are ways to remedy shipping and supply chain-specific negative reviews <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/when-bad-reviews-are-a-good-thing-guidelines-and-checklist-of-best-practices-for-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">without hiding them</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In general, only showing positive reviews on your ecommerce website is a red flag to online shoppers — they’re more likely to trust a 4-star rated product with a high volume of reviews rather than a product with just a few reviews.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Shoppers want to know whether or not shipping estimates are accurate. If you’re receiving consistent feedback that your estimates are inaccurate, the solution is to improve delivery estimates rather than hide the negative reviews.</p><h2 id=\"\">Establish an Escalation and Communication Plan for Supply-Chain Related Reviews</h2><p id=\"\">To expedite the complaint resolution process, having a formalized escalation and investigation procedure for every element of your supply chain and distribution networks is vital. Keeping an eye on your <a href=\"https://www.inventory-planner.com/lead-time-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">lead time in supply chain</a> is one of many ways you can get ahead of issues, and one of your first ports of call for investigation should things go awry.</p><p id=\"\">Being able to demonstrate an effective investigatory process means all customers can expect consistency, and you increase the chances of positive reviews on your resolution. It doesn’t take much for negative feedback around your fulfillment to accumulate. After a certain point, it becomes much more difficult to show commitment to resolution and claw back positive sentiment.</p><p id=\"\">Look at it this way, would a few bad reviews out of thousands put you off a purchase? Where’s your individual threshold for negative reviews vs. total reviews? As a business, you should aim to mitigate the lowest common denominator and keep the batting average as strong as possible.</p><p id=\"\">With Pixlee TurnTo, brands can set up <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/reviews/moderation\" target=\"_blank\">moderation</a> for trigger words in reviews. Only the reviews that contain words related to shipping are hidden until a moderator reviews, and then flagged to send to customer services if needed. The rest of the reviews you receive can be automatically published. This reduces the time and effort spent sifting for reviews related to this specific problem.</p><h2 id=\"\">Separate Product-Specific Feedback and Delivery-Related Reviews</h2><p id=\"\">In addition to moderating reviews for specific trigger words, there are other ways to reduce the negative impact of bad reviews due to shipping and supply chain problems. With Pixlee TurnTo, brands can work to isolate the shipping rating from the opinion about the product by creating “how was shipping” ratings-type subdimension.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, brands can configure Pixlee TurnTo review collection forms to encourage product-specific feedback. For example, brands using Google Seller Ratings can direct customers to leave delivery-related feedback through that channel rather than in the product’s own reviews. Pixlee TurnTo’s <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/features-and-use-cases/seller-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">seller ratings</a> add-on gives customers a valid outlet for concerns that aren’t product-related.</p><p id=\"\">Lastly, ensure that you’re waiting to ask for reviews until after the product is actually delivered. Work with your Ratings &amp; Reviews provider to configure feedback requests properly, as customers hate getting asked to review products they haven’t received!&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Pixlee TurnTo allows brands to configure review solicitation emails (RSEs) so that they’re sent only after the customer has received the product. Changes like estimated delivery date delays can also be accounted for so the RSE is timed correctly. This ensures a smoother process than calculating RSE send date based on when the customer purchased the product.</p><h2 id=\"\">Own the Issue</h2><p id=\"\">Shipping and supply chain issues are rarely a result of things that happen in-house. Despite this, customers may still blame your brand for a delayed parcel.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Complaints and bad reviews can be some of the most <a href=\"https://www.brightpearl.com/blog/how-to-handle-your-online-stores-difficult-customers\" target=\"_blank\">difficult customer interactions</a> to navigate, particularly when not entirely your fault. However, that customer is in your care regardless of which stage of their fulfillment failed them. You chose your distributor, your courier, your inventory management software; you must own those decisions and remain brave in the face of adversity.</p><p id=\"\">That’s not to say that customers won’t be amenable to a little insider knowledge. Letting them know there was an issue with courier turnaround times or supplier quantities is transparency without blame. These things happen, after all.</p><p id=\"\">In cases like this, composing <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/effective-email-copy-for-ecommerce-sites\" target=\"_blank\">effective review request email copy</a> is vital. Taking some time to workshop templated responses will save you time when it comes to bottlenecks that impact large numbers of consumers. When responding to reviews and online feedback, though, keep it bespoke, personal, and empathetic. All reviews are emotional responses and speak to the individual means by which people interact with your business and product.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Where you don’t have such direct visibility over a particular area of your supply chains, such as shipping or transit, a bespoke holding message is best to allow you time to look into the issue, which brings us neatly to our next point.</p><h2 id=\"\">Take the Conversation Private Where Possible</h2><p id=\"\">You can’t always control the narrative or direction in which a follow-up interaction may go, so it’s important to gear any subsequent responses into offline channels.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Email, DM, or a good old-fashioned phone call with <a href=\"https://www.dialpad.com/products/cloud-phone-system/\" target=\"_blank\">cloud phone service from Dialpad</a> can get you one-on-one and stop your resolution process from becoming a spectator sport. Pixlee TurnTo’s flagging capabilities also allow moderators to email reviews to specific team members who are best suited to deal with any issues raised in the review. This is another effective way of moving the conversation forward in a private channel.</p><h2 id=\"\">Leverage Negative Feedback</h2><p id=\"\">Reviews play a more critical role than ever in consumer research. Their presence across eCommerce platforms has increased exponentially as businesses realize the importance of peer feedback and social proof in customer decision-making.</p><p id=\"\">The presence of negative reviews, and visibly active participation in resolving them, can do more to <a href=\"https://www.cococart.co/resources/delight-customers-build-brand-loyalty\" target=\"_blank\">build brand loyalty</a> than five-star reviews eclipsing your landing page.</p><p id=\"\">Use the inevitable negative feedback as an opportunity to win over a disappointed customer, and improve business on your end. If you’ve successfully resolved their issue, consider including a link in their final contact resolution message, requesting a testimonial, incentivized by a next-purchase discount.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Most customers will understand that shipping and supply chain issues are much more outside of a business’s control than other fulfillment steps. Where this has been the sticking point, they could easily be more amenable to balancing their earlier feedback with some positive comments if they know you’ve been a champion on their behalf with your service partners!</p><p id=\"\">It’s incredibly useful to address past issues as part of your future marketing. “You Spoke, We Listened” is a phrase seen often in such instances, and it’s there for a reason.</p><p id=\"\">Should your supplier or inventory management evolve as a result of continuous improvement, be transparent and use real-world examples to show how you have been listening. Every company promises to change but showing active evolution built on a foundation of historical and invaluable customer feedback can set you apart from the majority.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Gauge Your Supply Chain Effectiveness</h2><p id=\"\">Reviews are an invaluable source of information about how your company is performing. Now more than ever, potential consumers are factoring peer review into their buying decisions and crucial research.</p><p id=\"\">It’s no small leap, then, that when it comes to customer opinion on your shipping and supply chain infrastructure, you should also be using this intel to make improvements.</p><h2 id=\"\">It’s Not the End of the World</h2><p id=\"\">If there’s one thing to take away from any of the above, it’s that negative reviews are inevitable but by no means terminal. Any successful business won’t be able to meet the needs of 100% of customers 100% of the time.</p><p id=\"\">Having the courage to meet negative feedback head-on, accept it and mitigate it as one of the many plates you have spinning is the mark of effective and admirable business.</p><p id=\"\">The true legends will be able to take the negative, act on it, and have a customer singing their praises while their negative review is still hot off the proverbial presses!</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\"><em>Jessica Day is the Senior Director for Marketing Strategy at Dialpad, a modern business communications platform that takes every kind of conversation to the next level—turning conversations into opportunities via </em><a href=\"https://www.dialpad.com/features/interactive-voice-response/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dialpad IVR solutions</em></a><em>.

Needless to say, identifying your website’s primary conversion drivers is crucial. Without identifying and later, testing, you can’t expect to improve conversions on a larger scale.But with the right tracking in place, you can analyze not just <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-measure-customer-engagement-and-why-its-important/\" target=\"_blank\">customer engagement</a>, but also which traffic sources are contributing the most to your bottom line.</p><p>Luckily, with Google Analytics, you can glean a lot of helpful insights—but going one step beyond, how do you use those insights to make actionable changes to convert more shoppers on your site?</p><h2>Define Your Conversions</h2><p>CXL institute<a href=\"https://conversionxl.com/2016-conversion-optimization-report/\" target=\"_blank\"> states that</a> 55% of companies plan to spend more on conversion rate optimization. So you don’t want your business to be left behind.</p><p>However, before identifying conversion points on your website, you should have a clear understanding of what visitor actions count as conversions, and set those as conversions in your analytics platform. For many ecommerce marketers, a conversion would be when a visitor makes a payment to place an order for your product.</p><p>With regard to Google Analytics, these actions are referred to as “goals.” If you haven’t already, here’s how you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032415?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">choose and create the right goals</a>. Once the goals are in place, give your analytics solution a few days to accumulate conversion data. Next, you’ll be ready to dig through and identify conversion points.</p><h2>Identifying Conversion Points</h2><p>There are many reports within Google Analytics where you can identify your conversion drivers. &nbsp;Let’s take a look at the major places to look into.</p><h3>Pages/Posts Driving Conversions</h3><p>Let’s say you’re publishing new content on a regular basis and you want to analyze how successful those pages are at triggering conversions.</p><p>From the navigation menu on the left, go to Behavior → Site Content → Landing Pages. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1950px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1950px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a594d2bf8557bda4b68_image3-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>On the right side of the table, you’ll see some extra columns associated with your conversion goals. More specifically, you’ll be able to see the number of conversions and conversion rates.</p><p>Armed with information on which pages are converting the best, you can restructure your website and create more similar pages and content. After all, the human brain forms its first impression <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/visual-content-marketing-16-eye-popping-statistics-you-need-to-know.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 50 milliseconds</a>, so dedicating resources to an aesthetically pleasing, <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-visual-marketing-facts-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">visual landing page</a> ensures you make that first impression a positive one.</p><p>In addition, you can take note to avoid creating additional types of pages that do not perform well. </p><h3>Traffic Sources Driving Conversions</h3><p>This is one of the reports where conversion tracking really shines. It allows you to reveal some great insights. To get to this report, go to Acquisition → All Traffic → Channels.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1950px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1950px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a59ce071c9929af1574_image5-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Here you can see each traffic source and associated conversion rate. That’s not all. You can click on a traffic source to dig deeper.For example, if you click “Referral,” you’ll see the exact websites sending traffic to yours, and sort this data by conversion rate. Click on a domain to see the individual pages sending you high-converting traffic. Why is this important? Because then you can take steps to promote these pages even more to give them a traffic boost. These pages, in return, will send you more visitors who are likely to convert.</p><p>On the same note, you will obviously find domains that promote a lot of traffic that doesn’t ultimately convert. You can analyze these cases and try to understand why.</p><p>From there, you can fix the problem or spend less effort on getting backlinks from similar websites in the future.</p><h3>Visualize Conversion Paths</h3><p>81% of sales happen until after<a href=\"https://www.leadpages.com/blog/converted-conference-startling-stats-marketing-trends-2015/\" target=\"_blank\"> 7 or more contact occurrences</a>. So, you can imagine how important it is to understand each step a visitor takes on the way to conversion.</p><p>That’s why visualizing your conversion paths can help. Google Analytics has a separate section devoted to conversions at Conversions → Goals.</p><p>One of the most useful reports here is Reverse Goal Path. It lets you quickly see the pages and posts sending the most conversions. Another is the Funnel Visualization.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1950px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1950px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a593ede1d925c532839_image4-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p> The funnel visualization helps you understand the funnel steps where visitors are dropping off the most.</p><p>You can use this information to plug in the leaks and optimize your funnel accordingly.</p><h3>Devices Driving Conversions</h3><p>If you know the devices from where most conversions come from, you’ll know on which devices to test your website or app first. This will save precious time and also improve conversions.</p><p>So head over to Audience → Mobile → Devices. Then prioritize developing the design specifications for the exact models which are converting the most.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1950px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1950px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a58da8ba1174fa11664_image2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>From this report, you can also see which devices contribute the most to your traffic yet have a low conversion rate. These should also get your attention so you can identify the cause and come up with a resolution.</p><h3>Optimization: <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">User-Generated Content</a> (UGC) Driving Conversions</h3><p>Since 41% of consumers only need to see between <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=UGC%20is%2035%25%20more%20memorable,campaigns%20or%20websites%20without%20it.&text=Consumers%20on%20average%20spend%205.4,day%20with%20user%2Dgenerated%20content.\" target=\"_blank\">one and four UGC reviews</a> in order to be influenced to purchase, it’s a must-have to boost conversion rates while promoting an authentic community on your company’s site.</p><p>Pixlee automatically pulls in UGC from fans on your social media platforms of choice, allowing you to curate the pieces of content to best fit your website.

    "content": "<p>One of the reasons most organizations don’t get the most out of their user-generated content is because UGC tends to live within their social media or customer marketing department, and this department doesn’t always live on the same proverbial floor as their bloggers, web copywriters, and other marketing team members who manage their CMS or website/blog updates.</p><p>This disconnect results in underutilization of their UGC, leaving money on the table. However, mapping out your UGC assets to your marketing processes, and operationalizing it into your team’s workflows will ensure that you are able to get the most out of your customers’ content.</p><p>Before we get into these tactics, here is how UGC is incorporated within an inbound-aligned company.</p><h3><strong>Inbound Strategy and UGC</strong></h3><p>Each stage of the inbound methodology is aligned with how buyers research, connect with and buy from organizations. UGC has a place within each stage, and within each stage, there are tactics and tools that enable you to <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-proof-ecommerce/304801/\" target=\"_blank\">provide social proof to your buyers</a>.</p><p>Here are the three stages and corresponding tools of the inbound methodology. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1336px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1336px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e28f33a98aa1a1d955eb0_UGCinboundimage.png\" alt=\"UGCinboundimage\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>These are general guidelines, and your organization may be using different tools and tactics based on your company’s goals and customers’ preferences. By understanding the tactics involved in each stage, you can map out elements of UGC according to your customers’ buying process.</p><h3><strong>Mapping Out Your UGC</strong></h3><p>Before you think through how you are going to promote your UGC, take an inventory of it. Use this table to map out the types of UGC you have at your disposal to use across your website, social channels, email, ads, conversational content, or other branded content:<strong>Marketing StageAttractEngageDelightContent Format</strong></p><ul> \t<li><strong>Educational guest blog posts from your customers </strong></li> \t<li><strong>User-generated videos from your last event/conference</strong></li></ul><ul> \t<li><strong>Testimonials</strong></li> \t<li><strong>Instagram posts from your customers</strong></li></ul><ul> \t<li><strong>Customer quotes </strong></li> \t<li><strong>Customer success stats</strong></li></ul><p>After mapping out your content, you’ll be in a solid position to integrate it into your day-to-day processes.</p><h3><strong>Integrating UGC into Your Processes</strong></h3><p>Here are two methods to help your team operationalize UGC:</p><ol> \t<li> <strong>Templatization:</strong> When your agency, bloggers, or web copywriters sit down to complete a project, how have you made it simple for them to incorporate UGC? How are the UGC requirements mapped out for them to incorporate it into your website? Through a simple field in your web copy or blogging templates, you can provide them with a link to your UGC that is clearly mapped out by your Buyer’s Journey stage. The ultimate goal is to make it as seamless as possible for your team to add UGC into your web copy or editorial content. \t</li><li><strong>CMS integration: </strong>How easy is it for your team to showcase UGC on your site? Tools such that enable dynamic content display in both your website (and other marketing initiatives) can make it a breeze for your web team to bring your UGC to life. One of the biggest mistakes we see in this area is brands inability to add a bit of polish to their UGC. If your customers are providing quotes, images, or mentions on social, then make sure they stand out on your website and don’t appear to be an afterthought.</li></ol><p>UGC shouldn’t be something that only your social team is responsible for. Social credibility plays a powerful role in moving your prospects through each stage of the buyer’s journey. By mapping out your UGC, updating your content creation process, and adding UGC modules/tools in your CMS, you’ll be well on your way to extracting more value from your customers’ word of mouth.</p><p>‍<em>PAUL SCHMIDT is a senior strategist at </em><a href=\"https://www.smartbugmedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SmartBug Media</em></a><em>™.

    "content": "<p>One of the core social media marketing tactics businesses rely on is <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">influencer marketing</a>. By creating authentic relationships with individuals who hold sway over a large group of consumers on social media, brands can harness their target audiences in a way they’ll trust. After all, influencer marketing is the fastest-growing channel for customer acquisition, and <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-50-user-generated-content-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">76% of marketers</a> consider influencer engagement effective in garnering customer loyalty.</p><p>While email and influencer marketing have distinct differences, combining them offers your brand a unique opportunity to garner brand awareness and interest in your products on social media. In this article, you would learn why it is useful and how to accurately integrate both tactics. </p><h2>Benefits of Using Influencers for Email Marketing</h2><p>Businesses can reach a diverse group of consumers through their connections with influencers. This is effective for improving conversion rates, while also extending your brand’s virtual community and building a strong relationship with a professional in your industry’s social sphere. Influencers use their platforms to persuade their followers to buy the products or subscribe and promote the products as well. On the other hand, brands can repurpose the content influencers create to fit into their email marketing campaigns. These include content like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/unboxing-videos-an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-sourcing-creating-and-monetizing-unboxing-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">unboxing videos</a>, product reviews, <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-ways-ambassador-marketing-can-benefit-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\">affiliate discount codes</a>, tutorial videos, and simple posts from the influencer interacting with your product. Generally, adding influencer content improves brand credibility via social proof. When a customer is reading your brand’s newsletter or sales email, spotting an influencer they already know will increase the chance they find your business more credible.</p><h2>Integrate Influencer Marketing &amp; Email Marketing</h2><p>The following are some strategies to align email and influencer marketing components together and gain unified benefits.</p><h3>1. Use Existing Influencer Content in Emails</h3><p>Most influencer relationships are established via social media, but that doesn’t mean content needs to stay there. Showcasing the creativity that creators like influencers are already skilled at is essential in your emails. This method demonstrates authenticity in your brand-influencer relationship as well due to dual-sided publicity. In the end, you’ll get significantly more value out of your influencer relationships by featuring existing influencer content you’ve permissioned in your promotional emails.</p><h3>2. Make Your Email Campaigns Mutually Beneficial </h3><p>Most influencers build their following via social media platforms. By promoting influencer content in your emails, you’re giving them a new avenue to reach engaged customers – who may become followers as well. By highlighting an influencer’s content and providing some additional credit to their owned channels, you can create a mutually beneficial program that builds your email community through value-added content. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1460px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1460px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a8c4d93af858e733e5d_zebra-pen-email.jpeg\" alt=\"Influencer email from Zebra Pen\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Zebra Pen showcases the artwork of influential graphic designers, linking to their social pages and posts as well as a Pixlee-powered <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-things-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-pixlee/pixlee-interactive-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">interactive gallery</a> of posts on the brand’s site.</p><p>This content, while inherently promotional of your products, adds more value than your standard sales email. This also shows customers that you’re focused on giving credit to the original creators of the content, thus encouraging customers to share their own content with the brand for a chance to be featured.</p><h3>3. Let Influencers Own the Email Campaign </h3><p>Brands tend to over-index on brand safety when it comes to influencer marketing. But by giving influencers more creative and strategic input on a campaign, you can create truly exciting and, oftentimes, vastly original campaigns. &nbsp;This is a great way to scale email personalization; influencers can create personalized content keeping the taste and preferences of their followers in mind. This can add a more personable edge to your emails, creating a more engaged community and, ultimately, better conversion rates overall.</p><h3>4. Think Macro and <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\">Micro Influencers</a></h3><p>Statistically, <a href=\"https://ownersmag.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=1%20As%20the%20influencer%20marketing%20industry%20rises%2C%20print,the%20scene%20%28Influencer%20Marketing%20Hub%29.%20More%20items...%20\" target=\"_blank\">67% of businesses</a> rely on the picture-centric Instagram platform primarily for social media marketing. Images are attractive to most consumers for viewing a product or brand or developing a brand impression. Therefore, brands find visual content-based promotion more lucrative for their marketing plans. <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-visual-marketing-facts-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual marketing</a> results in more conversions, lower bounce rates, and an increase in shares with the viewer’s own community</p><p>.The marketing team of a company can opt for high-quality featured images directly from influencers of all sizes. Make use of influencer discovery to find the influencers for your brand, from smaller-scale creators to big-time celebrities, and everything in between. You can also tap into the existing wealth of content your everyday customers are already creating for you through complementing influencer content with user-generated content (UGC). By showing your customer community’s organic posts with your products, you’ll massively grow social proof and trust in your brand. Word-of-mouth marketing generates more than <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-visual-marketing-facts-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">twice the sales of paid advertising, and 74% of consumers</a> rely on social media to inform their purchasing decisions, so UGC is a guaranteed win for your emails.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1460px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1460px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a8c889fbd08141390f4_alo-email.jpeg\" alt=\"Kendall Jenner and other fans in Alo Yoga apparel\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Alo Yoga showcases Kendall Jenner in the brand’s apparel as seen on her Instagram, and also features fan favorites in the form of UGC from happy customers. </p><h3>5. Don’t Stop at Product Images: Product Reviews and Unboxing Videos</h3><p>Product reviews and unboxing videos are commonly used formats for influencer marketing. In your emails, add helpful product reviews coupled with influencer testimonials and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/unboxing-videos-an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-sourcing-creating-and-monetizing-unboxing-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">unboxing videos</a> to seal the deal. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a8cf862bfa122653fc9_jane-k-email.jpeg\" alt=\"Jewelry influencer in Jane Konig email and her favorite pieces\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Jewelry brand Jane Koenig introduces an influencer partnership with Fia Hamelijnck and shares her favorite pieces of jewelry from the brand to inspire customers to shop.</p><p>For all subscribers, seeing new positive feedback from an individual they trust translates to increased interest in your brand. Also, the email should have detailed and real information; this increases consumers’ respect for the brand. Both email marketing and influencer marketing are effective approaches for business owners to advertise their products. With the right strategy, users can engage with more customers, increase conversion rates, sales, and brand popularity. Influencer content is powerful. So powerful that it shouldn’t be siloed to one channel. By using influencers and (more broadly) social proof in the form of user-generated content in your marketing emails, you stand to improve conversion and create an airtight community of adoring fans.</p><p>‍<em>This article is written by Vibhu Dhariwal, Co-Founder &amp; Director of Marketing at </em><a href=\"https://www.thegratifiedblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Digital Gratified</em></a><em>, a Digital Marketing &amp; Web Development company.</em></p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Following TikTok’s rise in popularity over the last few years, Instagram has shifted its focus to embrace short-form video content through <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/what-are-instagram-reels-plus-3-brands-winning-with-instagram-reels\" target=\"_blank\">Reels</a>. Compared to other post formats on Instagram, Reels are more likely to go viral because they’re often featured on the Explore page, and Instagram generally tends to surface more video content to users today than in previous years. This shift sets the stage for new strategies and approaches to <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram marketing</a>.</p><p id=\"\">This doesn't mean that when you publish a Reel, it will automatically become viral. While there isn't a certain blueprint for virality, there are several actions you can take to improve your chances. Whether you’re a content creator or a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/infographic-social-media-manager-jobs-what-to-expect\" target=\"_blank\">social media manager</a> for a brand on Instagram, these tips will help you reach a wider audience while putting out valuable content that engages your existing followers.</p><p id=\"\">Let’s dive into the tips and check out some brands that have gone viral on Instagram.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Keep It Short and Sweet</h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-reels\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram Reels</a> were originally designed to be short-form, but the app now supports videos up to 15 minutes long. However, the duration of your Instagram Reel also determines the level of engagement you get, and long Instagram Reels can lead to your audience losing interest in your video. As a result, the algorithm would be informed that your material isn't compelling enough. Really short Instagram Reels, on the other hand, may not be enough to engage viewers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But what do we mean exactly by long and short? What is the ideal Instagram Reel length?</p><p id=\"\">In general, it's best to keep your Reel between <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-reel-length/\" target=\"_blank\">7 and 15 seconds</a>. This is just enough to hook the viewer and keep them engaged until the end while giving you time to convey your message.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f68544c437faa01045aa4a_image2%20(15).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Instagram reels from Alo Yoga\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Alo Yoga has amassed a large following on Instagram, and the brand’s Reels are typically around 15 seconds long.</p><p id=\"\">That’s not to say you should stick to this general rule. After all, what may work for some may not work for others. Expert marketers will tell you any good ecommerce, B2B, or <a href=\"https://crunch-marketing.com/blog/saas-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">SaaS marketing</a> strategy involves testing. So, experiment with Reel length and see which generates the best results for you. You can also view the analytics of your Reels with a professional account, which can help you determine which content lengths are resonating best with your online audience.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Post at the Right Time</h2><p id=\"\">While the content of your Reel is the most important part of going viral, posting it at the best time for your followers and target audience can improve its chances. On both TikTok and Instagram, the first few viewers of your videos essentially decide how your post ends up performing; if they scroll past and don’t engage, the algorithm is less likely to surface that video to other users.</p><p id=\"\">The global best time to post on Instagram is Wednesday at 11am, but tapping into your Instagram account’s analytics provides more insight on what times of the day and week are most valuable to your unique audience. Check out our post on <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/best-time-to-post-reels-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">the best times to post Instagram Reels</a> for more information on how to determine this.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Showcase Products in a Diverse Way</h2><p id=\"\">Instagram is the perfect platform for your product videos, whether you’re an influencer promoting a brand or a brand promoting its own goods. After all, a whopping 96% of people watch these types of videos. That means the chances of your Reel going viral are high.</p><p id=\"\">Make sure you show the product in action and highlight its benefits. Include footage of your product being used if you can. Some creative ways to do this include <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-unboxing-videos\" target=\"_blank\">unboxing videos</a>, tutorials, behind-the-scenes videos, and before-and-after shots.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f68553aaf489675ebab094_image4%20(10).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Instagram Reels from Puma\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Make sure you use clear, high-quality footage. You want to showcase your product. You can’t do that if your footage is poorly lit or blurry, so don't be afraid to cut, reshoot, or condense scenes. You want to keep the viewer engaged.</p><p id=\"\">Finally, at the end of the Reel, include a call to action. Make it clear what you want the viewer to do next. For product videos, make sure to tag the product from your <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/instagrams-checkout-feature-what-brands-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram storefront</a> so viewers can easily shop straight from your post.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Choose the Right Music or Audio Clip</h2><p id=\"\">Using music or a trending audio clip in your Instagram Reel can help you get more Reel engagement. The audio you choose should depend on what your Reel is about. It should also depend on the brand personality you wish to portray. For instance, if you were showcasing your newly-opened pub in your Reel, you might want to use catchy, casual music. Your goal, after all, is to package your pub as a fun place where people dine and socialize.</p><p id=\"\">If, on the other hand, you’re aiming to educate your audience about the details of a product, you may want to choose some light instrumental music with a voiceover.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You can use popular sounds that aren’t necessarily music, too. That can help you increase the reach and visibility of your Reel. The more people watch a Reel with a specific sound, the more videos with the same audio appear on their feed.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">So, bear in mind the following tips when using music for your video:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Jump on trends. </strong>The algorithm pushes Instagram Reels that use audio at the height of their popularity.&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consider the lyrics of the song.</strong> If your piece of content has dialogue or voiceover, make sure the lyrics of the song don't distract from or compete with voice audio in your Instagram Reel.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Pay attention to copyright</strong>. Make sure you have the proper permissions to use music in your video. Many websites offer royalty-free music from their music library. You can use these options without worrying about <a href=\"https://legismusic.com/music-copyright-problems-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">copyright</a> issues.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Don't be afraid to try out a few different songs in your music library to see which one works best.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Feature Your Community’s UGC</h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\">User-generated content</a> (UGC) is any form of original and unpaid content that has been created by users. It can come in the form of reviews, photos, and videos, but most often is sourced from social media posts themselves.</p><p id=\"\">UGC has been found to generate a <a href=\"https://everyonesocial.com/blog/user-generated-content-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">29% higher customer engagement</a> than other types of content. This means if you use UGC in your Reel, you can increase your chances of going viral. So how do you find the right UGC to use?</p><p id=\"\">While you can search through hashtags related to your niche, brand, or products, using a UGC platform like Pixlee TurnTo provides an easy way to automatically collect and curate video content (from Instagram Reels, other social platforms, or a direct upload) originally created by your community.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1650px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1650px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63f6855f83bfa527889ff773_image1%20(14).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Instagram Reel in the Pixlee TurnTo platform\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Choose collection criteria for your UGC like your branded hashtag or posts that your account has been tagged in, and get permission to reuse that content in your own Reels, all without leaving the platform.</p><p id=\"\">Social media contests are a great way to solicit UGC from your existing followers and broader community. For instance, you can say those who make the most creative Reel showcasing your new product can get a 25% discount at your store on their first purchase. Notice that the giveaway should be related to what you’re offering. This way, you ensure the people you engage are also the ones more likely to buy from you.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You can then reuse this content (with permission from its creator) in your future Instagram Reels and other marketing channels.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Collaborate With Other Brands and Influencers</h2><p id=\"\">Collaborating with <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/types-of-influencers\" target=\"_blank\">influencers</a> on Instagram Reels can be a valuable way to promote your brand.

It’s clear that traditional outbound marketing doesn't click.

The best way to generate social proof for your brand is to use social media influencers and your customers' peers. Marketers should encourage online conversations between current and potential customers to drive more sales. A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is, it is what consumers tell each other it is.</p><p><strong>Create Authentic Marketing</strong>The majority of global consumers say that they would buy from a company that they consider to be authentic over all other competitors. But what makes for an authentic brand? For starters, authentic brands represent their products in a truthful way. They display photos of real customers enjoying their products to help browsers better relate to their brand. Authentic brands also cater to the value of their community and support causes important to their customers.</p><p><strong>Communicate Online</strong>50% of Millennial customers say that the best way to communicate with them is on the Internet and through <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/shoppable-social-galleries\" target=\"_blank\">social media.</a> This makes sense, given that, as a demographic, they average 5.4 hours every day on social platforms. If your brand is able to reach Millennials online, it is likely that they will help you to spread your brand message. Generation Y is the first generation that wants to engage with and share your brand's ads that resonate with them. Millennials and social media go hand-in-hand.</p><p><strong>Use Visual Platforms</strong>Visual social platforms are generating the most engagement among Millennials. In fact, Generation Z communicates best with images. This means that brands that are active on social platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, Vine, Youtube, and Snapchat should <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/benefits/improve-brand-engagement\" target=\"_blank\">expect to see higher levels of engagement.</a> When it comes to video platforms, Millennials are the most active video viewers of any age group.</p>",

In today's day and age, consumers can share their experiences with your company in a matter of seconds. Whether these are shared through Instagram posts, Yelp reviews, Youtube videos, or in other ways, user-generated content has become increasingly prevalent and important for brands to maintain in order to influence customers' purchasing decisions. </p><blockquote>Why should brands prioritize earned content? <a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/infographics/millennials-love-user-generated-content-infographic-01497502#hXZRdWDutGo7Vk0B.97\"> 64% of consumers look for peer reviews online before making a purchase</a>.</blockquote><p>While many consumers have adverse reactions to feeling \"marketed to\" with brand advertisements, marketing with earned media does not solicit the same reaction.

However, measuring its ROI can be tricky, depending on what you're hoping to track.Here are a few ways to ensure that your user-generated content program is providing data-driven insights-- no matter how you're putting it to use. </p><h2><strong>Conversion Rate</strong></h2><p>User-generated content helps to add a layer of social proof and peer validation to help online shoppers, who may not be able to touch and feel a product as they would in a store, to make a purchase with confidence. We've found that, on average, displaying user-generated content on your website increases online conversions by 2x. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-study/goorin-bros-hat-shop\">One of our clients, Goorin Bros. Hat Shop, saw an 11% increase in total online sales after incorporating user-generated content into its marketing.</a> To track conversions from user-generated content, tag product SKUs in each photo or video and track click-through to product page and/or shopping cart.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:768px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"768px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628cecd1cfba19bb8e984be4_Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-2.31.36-PM-768x480.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>Average Order Value</strong></h2><p>Galleries of user-generated content can also be used to increase product discovery-- and ultimately average order value. Pixlee client <a href=\"https://assets.pixlee.com/website/hubspot/pdf/Case-Studies/Enerskin-Pixlee-Case-Study.pdf\">Enerskin increased average order value by 76% by displaying user-generated content on its homepage.</a> &nbsp;</p><p>Displays of real customer photos and videos can be automated to display personalized content based on consumer behavior. Using homepage galleries with predictive content makes it easier for browsers to find the products that they are looking for more quickly. To track average order value, tag product SKUs in each photo or video and bucket all average order values by if or if not they have interacted with the user-generated content on your site.</p><h2><strong>Reach</strong></h2><p>Browsers are more likely to engage with your brand if you build deeper relationships with them. To do so, consider all aspects of your user-generated content strategy as means by which to build a two-way dialogue with your brand's biggest fans. Reach out to consumers directly on social media to permission user-generated content, share user-generated content to celebrate your customers, and encourage them to post about your brand. </p><p>To track your brand's reach, &nbsp;calculate the sum of the followers of the users who create and/or engage with your user-generated content.</p><h2><strong>Time on Site</strong></h2><p>User-generated content attracts visitors to your site, and the longer they spend on your site, the greater the chance they will convert into paid customers. Sites that feature UCG have up to<a href=\"https://www.tintup.com/blog/38-mind-blowing-stats-effectiveness-user-generated-content/\"> a 90% increase in time consumers spend on their site</a>, and a 20% increase in return visitors. To track time on site, use Google Analytics to compare time on site for pages with galleries of user-generated content to pages that do not. </p><h2><strong>Bounce Rate</strong></h2><p>The bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave the site, having viewed only one page. The higher the bounce rate, the greater the chance that your site is not effectively engaging consumers. This may be because your efforts aren’t attracting the right site visitors, or because visitors aren’t provided with a good user experience. One of the best ways to decrease your bounce rate is to improve your<a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/blog/13-ways-to-reduce-bounce-rate-and-increase-your-conversions/\"> brand storytelling with customer photos and videos</a>. To track how our displays of user generated content affect bounce rates, use Google Analytics to compare bounce rates for pages with galleries of user-generated content to pages that do not. </p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>All of these metrics can be easily tracked with a user-generated content platform such as Pixlee. Our platform helps e-commerce marketers to collect, curate, and display user-generated content-- but also to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/product#measure\">measure the direct ROI of using customer photos and videos across marketing channels</a>. </p><p>Curious to see how your earned content is performing?

Consumers today often research <a href=\"https://mywifequitherjob.com/what-can-i-sell-to-make-money/\" target=\"_blank\">products and services online</a> before making a purchase, and ratings and reviews can be a key part of that research; if people like them are enjoying the product, they’re more likely to purchase!</p><p id=\"\">Quality and quantity are equally important when it comes to product reviews. A customer is much more likely to trust a 4-star product with 100 reviews than a 5-star product with just one or two. Additionally, including product attributes and subdimensions for reviewers give your shoppers more information to help them feel confident in their purchase.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2346px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2346px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63e2a04583b7456b5f7bbc89_bobs%20red%20mill%20review%20(1).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of Bob's Red Mill review with subimensions\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Improved Search Engine Rankings</h3><p id=\"\">Search engines use complex algorithms to determine the relevance and authority of a website. One of the factors that these algorithms consider is the presence of customer reviews and ratings. Websites with many positive reviews and high ratings are seen as more trustworthy and relevant, helping them rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, having customer reviews and ratings also helps to increase the click-through rate (CTR), as these signals often appear in the SERPs and can make the website more attractive to potential customers.

On the other hand, negative reviews can be damaging to a business’s reputation if not handled properly.</p><h3 id=\"\">Address Issues Quickly &amp; Show Customer Care</h3><p id=\"\">Responding to reviews, both positive and negative, shows that the business cares about customer satisfaction and is willing to address any concerns. By regularly monitoring sites like Yelp, Google, and TripAdvisor along with native reviews on their ecommerce websites, companies can quickly identify problems with their products or customer service and take steps to address the issues that customers have raised.</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;By responding to reviews in a timely and professional manner, you demonstrate to the public that you’re willing to take responsibility and are committed to improving your products or services. This can help mitigate the damage and even turn a negative experience into a positive one.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Accrue Feedback for Product Improvement</h3><p id=\"\">Online ratings and reviews provide an open forum for customers to share their experiences, both the good and the bad, with a wide audience. Are people generally satisfied with your product or service? What aspect of the product needs work?</p><p id=\"\">Online ratings and reviews provide valuable insights into the performance and reputation of the business. By monitoring and responding to them, business owners can better understand what customers like and dislike about their products or services. This information can be used to improve products or services, address any issues with customer service, and make informed decisions about how to better meet the needs of customers.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Monitor &amp; Respond to Reviews&nbsp;</h1><h3 id=\"\">Review Moderation Tools</h3><p id=\"\">A review moderation tool determines whether to publish or hide a review based on customizable trigger words, and may flag reviews for a brand’s customer service team to resolve an issue (either by responding to the review, or contacting the reviewer directly).&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With three different support levels for moderation above a standard offering, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/reviews/moderation\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pixlee TurnTo’s review moderation services</a> allow your brand to choose the best fit depending on your goals and the volume reviews you’re collecting.

Here are a few elements you might want to consider adding to your response when a shopper says they love your product.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Thank the reviewer for their feedback.</strong> Just showing appreciation for shoppers who take time out of their day to write a review is underrated!

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Earlier this year, TikTok started testing several new features, including its own version of retweet with a \"Repost\" button.

With over a billion monthly active users, it's an ideal platform for brands to engage with audiences, build communities, <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/7-reasons-why-you-should-advertise-on-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">advertise</a>, and boost exposure.</p><p id=\"\">While creating original TikTok videos is important to establishing your account’s voice and identity, engagement with your online community can be just as important, especially for brands. Consumers are much more likely to respect, trust, and interact with your brand on TikTok if you’re resharing UGC from people like them.</p><p id=\"\">So, let's check out how to repost on TikTok and what opportunities this new feature brings to the table for marketers.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Repost on TikTok</h2><ol id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Open</strong> the video you’d like to repost.&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Click the <strong id=\"\">Share</strong> icon, a right-facing arrow.</li><li id=\"\">Tap the yellow <strong id=\"\">Repost</strong> button and add a comment to accompany your repost.</li><li id=\"\">Optional: add a <strong id=\"\">Comment</strong> that will be visible to users viewing your repost.</li></ol><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6317d2a7db65feacb236f4ac_Screen%20Shot%202022-09-06%20at%204.06.56%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The repost button shows up in the upper left corner of sharing options. After reposting, you’ll see the option to add a comment next to your profile picture, alternating with the message that “you reposted.”</p><p id=\"\">It’s also easy to remove a repost on TikTok; simply open the comments section of the video and hold down on the top message that says “Reposted this video” until the option to remove repost appears.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6317d2bb010838475499a8d9_Screen%20Shot%202022-09-06%20at%204.06.45%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">It’s also worthwhile to mention that, once you watch a video 3 times on a loop, the repost button will also appear above the creator’s username, as <strong id=\"\">a gray button that says the word “repost.”</strong></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63190ad47c02e46c99fa5d75_Screen%20Shot%202022-09-07%20at%202.18.52%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">As you've probably guessed from the above steps, the TikTok repost feature differs from its analogs on <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram</a>, Twitter, or <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/improve-your-facebook-ad-conversion-rate-with-pixlees-newest-feature\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook</a>.</p><p id=\"\">Two moments:</p><ol id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">You can only repost videos found in your For You feed or from a profile. </strong>Videos found on the explore page usually don’t have the repost option.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your reposted videos won't appear on your TikTok profile</strong>, only in the home feeds of your connections who are <em id=\"\">mutual friends</em> with you.</li></ol><p id=\"\">In other words, the purpose is to boost the visibility of the content TikTok algorithms recommend to you. Instead of sharing it with your contacts through <a href=\"https://bid4papers.com/blog/how-to-write-an-informative-essay/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">informative text</a> messages or other social channels, you’re increasing the reach of a video within the platform it originated on.</p><p id=\"\">The Repost button is an instrument for amplifying UGC and encouraging passive users (spectators) to participate on the platform. It's a low-friction way for them to let a broader audience see what they like, with no content creation but promoting the content of others.</p><p id=\"\">Given such limits, what's in it for brands? Can your business benefit from learning how to repost on TikTok? How can you get the most out of it for your social media marketing campaign?</p><p id=\"\">Let's find out!</p><h2 id=\"\">How Brands Can Benefit from Reposting UGC on TikTok</h2><p id=\"\">UGC on TikTok implies social selling, which looks more natural than obviously sales-oriented, promo ads from brands, thus evoking more trust in viewers. When watching content from real people they can relate to, social users have more confidence and trust in a brand’s products, and often want to become a part of its community.</p><p id=\"\">When users see others like them using a product, they're more likely to try it. Numbers speak volumes: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/whats-next-2022-community-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">67%</a> of users say TikTok inspires them to shop, even when they didn't plan to do so. In 2021, they spent $2.3 billion on the app, <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/news/tiktok-consumer-spending-up-77-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">77%</a> more than in 2020.</p><p id=\"\">For brands, TikTok UGC both inspires purchases and increases brand awareness with social proof. TikTok ad campaigns can be useful alongside organic posts, primarily when they either feature UGC or emanate the authenticity of UGC.</p><p id=\"\">So, <strong id=\"\">TikTok campaigns and UGC reposts help your brand:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Get more visibility and exposure</li><li id=\"\">Reach a new audience</li><li id=\"\">Engage more potential followers and future customers</li><li id=\"\">Build loyalty and trust (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/whats-next-2022-community-commerce\" id=\"\">73%</a> of TikTok users say they feel a deeper connection to companies they interact with on the app)</li><li id=\"\">Influence the decision to follow you (passive audience, so-called spectators), buy from you, or purchase from you again (returned customers)</li></ul><p id=\"\">‍</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62eab9f6e1a19d6994ed11fe_sTZ-1yPtO1c-Mu2h8iEIw0uoYVS6Iu0G6Mt27fIUjSBL2p5y_sSM4uPbJN25a5T2ywIeN7rupXSRKguOq9qPVpuY1FJCLg1YuphYOMO8yOwWmdVOauyMwPW7NTvCsynor0w9o2ELDAmzQd4lZvO98hc.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Revel Nail uses Pixlee TurnTo to collect UGC from its community and build a shoppable gallery of content linked in the brand’s TikTok bio, in addition to reposting the videos on the app.</p><p id=\"\">In addition to reposting content from your brand’s community, consider resharing content your brand gleans from <a href=\"http://pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a>.Given the nature of the TikTok repost feature, where you need a mutual friendship for content resharing, all these benefits also work well in <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-ultimate-influencer-pay-guide-for-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">partnership with influencers</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">Resharing TikTok Influencer Content&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">Reposting content created by your brand’s influencers and ambassadors works well on the app, but you can take that content’s value a step further by resharing it across your marketing channels. Get the most out of influencer content with these steps:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Find <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-find-niche-tiktok-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Niche TikTok influencers</a></h3><p id=\"\">First and foremost, it's critical to find influencers that will help you reach your business goals. Do you want to raise brand awareness through viral content? Reach out to your current customers and establish more loyalty? Drive conversion from the influencer’s followers?</p><p id=\"\">Depending on your plans for TikTok campaigns, it may be worth partnering with smaller-scale, niche TikTok influencers whose values and posts align with your brand and target audience. Micro-influencers tend to see higher engagement than macro-influencers or celebrities, and they can yield far more cost-effective partnerships.</p><p id=\"\">The results of the whole marketing campaign depend on choosing the <em id=\"\">right</em> content creators with the relevant and <em id=\"\">active</em> (responsive) audience. You can find content creators on TikTok already posting about your brand or product through hashtags and TikTok’s advanced searching feature.</p><p id=\"\">To save time, you may also consider an influencer marketing software like Pixlee TurnTo. Such platforms allow filtering creators' profiles to find the most promising influencers on TikTok, and help you identify potential advocates already mentioning your brand on the app.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c492fea5fe20a02bef225e_8-EqR99Ci6Nir7fbd3kN6ZQvJLUpAo_qs9TeP9dyWpnSy_DZLEORax0TsMe5QI9NTNpYqdtO8HTGBd2Udjdz5KrPxDTfpLuCPAYB_H3p3xCDfrchQ5scsFoHNiJhhAeVHJINnxJiXqDpLSpy-g.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Jolyn Swimwear uses Pixlee TurnTo to discover and reshare customer and influencer content with unique brand hashtags.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Follow Influencers on Your Brand Account</h3><p id=\"\">The next step is to follow the chosen TikTok influencers from your brand account. Subscribe to see their content, like, and comment on it. Make them understand you enjoy what they do and that you might be interested in collaboration.</p><p id=\"\">Curious, they'll go to check your TikTok profile and may follow you in return to seed the grain of a win-win partnership in the future. Engagement on and off the app is key here, as an influencer is more likely to partner with brands who appear genuinely interested in their content.</p><h3 id=\"\">3.

Reshare TikTok Influencer Videos</h3><p id=\"\">So, your partnership with TikTok content creators has started, and they craft content about your brand, its mission, and products. Now, it's high time for you to repost their content so your followers can see it in their For You feeds.</p><p id=\"\">What's in it for you in such reposts?</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">You build the loyalty and trust of your passive followers (spectators), influencing their decision-making to buy from you.</li><li id=\"\">You make your current customers feel a part of the community, motivating them to buy from your brand again.</li></ul><p id=\"\">In order to get the best benefits from TikTok influencer content, consider sharing their videos off of the TikTok app. While you can download TikTok videos directly, Pixlee TurnTo allows brands to automatically collect, curate, and publish content from authenticated influencers on a variety of channels, like on-site galleries.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You can also make this content shoppable to create a clear path-to-purchase for website visitors that’s backed by social proof. From then on, you can manage influencer relationships and content alongside everyday customer UGC in-platform, and even map specific content pieces to conversions and site visitor activity.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c492feb22803a49bf96bd9_2TG-UcShTUTPl0ri0bHpKmMNuf5KiZJY4cz_tbiwsb1AaZJ5dscFwAjTu0EANEQLyMHMs1xjAJk4yJM4vT1iECq7W3njqUdEdk4lBPlxSyIOaQ8pRfwyJnQNlFWigaDQzQstF-Dvpj50AvZh1w.png\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Embroidery brand DMC makes the most out of customer UGC and influencer content from TikTok with its “Shop the DMC TikTok” gallery of product-tagged posts.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Ask Influencers to Repost Your Content</h3><p id=\"\">Given that influencers follow your brand on TikTok, they can see your content and repost it from their feeds. Establish this at the beginning of your partnership for the best results. UGC, influencer content, and brand content can all work together when it comes to reposting and building the strongest level of brand awareness.</p><p id=\"\">What do you get from creators reposting your content?</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">More visibility and exposure</li><li id=\"\">Reaching a new audience</li><li id=\"\">Engaging more potential followers and future customers</li></ul><p id=\"\">Partnering with TikTok creators <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/whats-next-2022-creator-community\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">boosts view-through rates like crazy</a>, benefiting users as much as brands: 35% of TikTok users discover products and brands from creators, and 65% enjoy it when creators post about products and brands. Now, the TikTok repost feature provides another opportunity for users to see such posts.</p><h2 id=\"\">Make TikTok Reposts a Part of Your UGC Strategy</h2><p id=\"\">Although a \"Repost\" button is a relatively new TikTok feature with limited options (so far!), it's worth considering it an extra instrument for your UGC campaigns on this platform. Make connections with niche content creators, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">partner with them</a> for mutual promotion, and get the most out of it: exposure, new followers, loyal community, and — of course — sales.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Lesley Vos is a text author, blogging at </em><a href=\"https://bid4papers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Bid 4 Papers</em></a><em id=\"\"> and specializing in content creation and self-criticism.

Well-executed <a href=\"https://pixlee.com/use-cases/re-targeting-commerce-ads\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">retargeting</a> can educate customers through informative content on your blog, video demonstrations, and even user-generated tutorials. You can use this technique to provide the right content to your prospect at the right time in her buying cycle. In fact, keeping your brand top of mind is an important component of the buyer journey.</p><p id=\"\">Strikingly, <a href=\"https://digitalmarketingjobs.io/blog/retargeting-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">only 2% of visitors</a> buy on their first visit to a website. Can you afford to lose the business of 98% of your visitors? Keeping your brand top-of-mind for that consumer as they explore other sources for the product is half the challenge. And Instagram is a great channel to build coverage on – if you know how to use it.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Effective is Retargeting?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">According to <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/97225536354/infographic-7-incredible-retargeting-ad-stats\" id=\"\">Wishpond</a>, a prospect that you retarget is 70% more likely to convert. The effectiveness of these campaigns, however, depends on how carefully you’ve planned your strategy. If you’re going with the spray and pray approach, i.e., retarget everyone and hope they bite, you’ll get mediocre results at best.</p><p id=\"\">Retargeting anyone who visits your site is a common strategy that newbies employ. It’s the easiest way to get started, but it’s also an expensive way to go about this.Why? Simply because not everyone who visits your site is interested in your product. They might have clicked in by accident or to read a blog post. The point is that you’ll be paying for ad placements that might never bear fruit.</p><p id=\"\">What’s more effective is to insert these snippets of code on specific pages of your site. This allows you to link the right kind of content to the client.</p><p id=\"\">Say, for example, that your client makes it to the checkout but doesn’t complete the sale. Perhaps she wants to shop around a bit. Clearly, though, she’s interested in your product. Showing her a straight advert for items she looked at or a video demonstrating their features might get her to complete the sale.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, someone who’s only viewed the description page of your products needs a more subtle nudge. In this case, it might be better to link through to blog content that explains more about the problem that your product solves.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why Use Instagram Stories?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Instagram is a fast-growing social media platform. In October 2019, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">it ranked sixth</a> in terms of the overall number of users.

But making your chatbot feel as human as possible without missing out on service opportunities can be tough. While chatbots are amazing when it comes to providing businesses with automated customer service, they're even better for helping new potentials go through the conversion funnel. For brands to create human connections that meet the customer service requirements of today's consumers, brands should look at incorporating user-generated content with their chatbots.</p><h2>Understanding The Basics Of Chatbots And Their Limits</h2><p>In a nutshell, a chatbot is a programmed chat interface users can interact with. The idea is to mimic human behavior and make the customer feel as if they are being helped by an actual employee. Of course, we all know it’s just artificial intelligence doing what it does best. When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.drift.com/chatbot-examples/\" target=\"_blank\">chatbot consumer interaction</a> and intricacy, you have two options: <strong>Basic Chatbot</strong>Your basic chatbot reacts to pre-ordained keywords or commands written by your developer. These bots are simpler to implement, but have limited functionality, as they need an algorithm pre-programmed to answer consumer problems. <strong>Advanced Chatbot</strong>This is where the real magic happens. Your more advanced chatbots make use of Artificial Intelligence to communicate with your web traffic. They are able to essentially “learn” adequate responses for keywords, commands, and phrases entered by the user - Siri is a good example of this. When it comes to incorporating some UGC marketing strategies within our chatbot functionality, this advanced AI coding will be needed to get to the goals that we want to reach. Combining <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/user-generated-content-101/\">user-generated content</a> with chatbots is a natural progression for community-driven brands. In practice, this idea has seldom been tested, but there are plenty of potential use-cases for enterprising brands looking to take their chatbot and UGC game to the next level. </p><h2>Abandoned Cart Reminders via Facebook Messenger</h2><p>Cole Haan created a unique use case for chatbots. If a customer views a product on the website but leaves the page before making a purchase, their Facebook Messenger bot comes in handy. &nbsp;If the product they viewed has a UGC image assigned to it, then the user would get a Facebook message a few days later that asked the user if they were still interested in the product, with the style shown through the UGC images.</p><p>This clever use case relied on the user connecting their Facebook account to their Cole Haan account but ultimately helped bride the gap between the brand's social community and their sales funnel – juicing even more value out of their engaged audience.</p><h2>Using Keyword Phrases and AI To Pull User Reviews On A Product</h2><p>When we think about popular ways to build brand trust, word of mouth should be the first thing that comes to mind. Marketing studies <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/online-review-statistics/329701/#close\" target=\"_blank\">show that 91% of younger consumers</a> place more value on actually seeing a customer review for themselves on a website like Yelp instead of through a brand-controlled review system. But, searching Yelp and other review sites is a lot of effort. Why not be completely transparent with your potential consumers and build an open-door review system where users can get their reviews posted into a system for specific products and services?When a user opens up your website for the first time, the chatbot can list a couple of commands for different features you have available. One of these features can be “Show random review for X product/service.” If users type in the keyword and the product, the chatbot will automatically pull from the last five user-submitted reviews, showing that you care about transparency and the thoughts of your customers. A famous example of a <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/coca-cola-is-embracing-ai-and-chatbots-in-preparation-for-a-digital-first-future/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated chatbot is the Coca-Cola chatbot</a> on Viber that targeted Bulgarian customers with their Rakuten Viber messaging app, tracking subscribers, and engagement. They partnered with Vivoom to create an experience that invited customers to #beSanta and select from a list of good deeds to spread holiday cheer. Followers of the Coca-Cola chatbot were given a link to share their videos on Viber to their friends. This chain of events increased Viber subscriptions by 45%, with more than 1.5 million engagements. <strong>What To Keep In Mind: </strong>In theory, this idea could be revolutionary. However, we do have to keep in mind that spambots exist and may leave untruthful reviews. So, even though we want to keep it as transparent as possible, you will need to implement some form of verification. For example, a unique product identifier key that customers need to enter in order to leave a review helps maintain some security.</p><h2>The 'Show-Me' Tool That Features Users Interacting With Your Product </h2><p>How often have you been scrolling through the website of an online clothing store, and wondered what the clothes would actually look like on you? Even just with wearing glasses, it’s so hard to browse online before going into the store for the final purchase. Why not give your users the ability to see what fellow customers have purchased, and how they pull off the style? Using UGC you have already collected from existing customers, you can help new customers understand how the product looks on a person just like themselves. These images can then be loaded into the AI for your chatbot to use when certain commands are called. From here, a new user could type in a query such as “What would X product look like on me,” and the chatbot can use its new media gallery to pull the relevant images for the customer to review. This will help them get a better grasp of the product style and improve the likelihood of them going through the conversion phase of the sales funnel. </p><h2>The Future of Chatbots</h2><p>The power of chatbots, when enriched with UGC, is a surefire way to bring a more authentic and connected community feel to your website. Remember that automation doesn't have to become impersonal. In fact, automation should primarily be used to build better customer experiences – and that starts with showcasing the right content for your audience, in the channels they're engaging in most.</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Peruse creator and brand Instagram profiles briefly, and you’ll notice a design element many of them have in common. Their highlights, the small circles just below their bio on their profile, showcase some of that account's best content that was originally posted as an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/instagram-story\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram story</a>. In many cases, brands and creators use Instagram highlight covers, small circular designs, that organize and often label each highlight with an icon or design.</p><p id=\"\">Whether you want to design custom covers from scratch or use a pre-made template, many options are available to help you create stunning and professional-looking highlight covers that match your <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand voice on Instagram</a>. While you should use covers that accurately reflect your brand's unique identity and vision, remember that the content of those highlights is the most important part of your strategy.</p><h1 id=\"\">What are Instagram Highlights?</h1><p id=\"\">An Instagram highlight is a feature that allows users to create and store selected Instagram stories (video or static image) on their profile page, allowing visitors to access them for longer than the usual 24 hours. By compiling stories into curated collections, individuals can provide an overview of different elements of their lives, like travels or favorite recipes, for example.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1316px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1316px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63d9d0a22f8a142c69492d7c_Screen%20Shot%202023-01-31%20at%206.32.49%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Screenshot of Delta and Windsor's Instagram profiles \"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Highlights make it easy for those viewing the profile to quickly access important posts and moments from multiple stories.

In addition, highlighting content gives users more agency over what viewers learn about them and their projects, allowing them to tell their stories tailored and intentionally.</p><p id=\"\">As a brand, these highly visible Instagram highlights can help attract new followers, boost account engagement, and direct profile viewers to your ecommerce website. To create an Instagram highlight, you'll need a public Instagram account and the latest version of the Instagram app installed on your phone.

The best way to know what is trending is to spend some time scrolling through the videos to see what is popping up more often. Here are some examples of past trends that resonated well with audiences on Reels:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Transition Videos</h3><p id=\"\">Various trending audios like the remix of Drake’s hit song “Nonstop” are perfect for capturing dramatic transitions in Reels. Create a video that perfectly syncs with the beats and try to match the transition at a designated point in the audio.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1314px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1314px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62fb16ab79b9ead43bf4edee_Screen%20Shot%202022-08-15%20at%208.57.56%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Revel Nail uses its own original audio as well as audio from other users to showcase the brand’s color-changing polish with a transition from inside to outside in the sun.</p><h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-unboxing-videos\" target=\"_blank\">2. Unboxing Videos</a></h3><p id=\"\">Popular on YouTube and TikTok as well, unboxing videos are an example of a shopping-focused trend that’s more evergreen than one-off challenges or trending audio clips. Users share videos of themselves opening new purchases they’ve received from their favorite brands.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1408px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1408px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62fb16a24763ffe5ccdce0eb_Screen%20Shot%202022-08-15%20at%208.58.11%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">As a brand, you can reshare this type of content from your followers to generate buzz around new products like Mapiful and Nulo Pet Food do.</p><h3 id=\"\">3.

Behind-the-Scenes Videos</h3><p id=\"\">Brands active on Instagram Reels often tend to share behind-the-scenes, exclusive looks into the operations behind the brand, or through the lens of employees. This type of video humanizes the brand while providing educational, entertaining, or simply interesting content.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1564px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1564px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62fb16d060249a90b7af62df_Screen%20Shot%202022-08-15%20at%208.58.53%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Kally Sleep and My Mochi use Reels to showcase what goes into making their products while showing off the fun culture of the brands.</p><h2 id=\"\">Brands Using Instagram Reels for Marketing</h2><p id=\"\">Many brands with a strong presence on Instagram are already utilizing Reels as a core element of their social strategies. Here are 5 examples of companies using short-form video on Instagram to engage their audiences.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Morphe</h3><p id=\"\">The makeup and skincare industry is crushing it with reels. Morphe’s Reels typically show off new products and educate potential customers through tutorial and inspiration videos.

Redbull</h3><p id=\"\">Redbull is another brand that has taken Instagram by storm by using reels as a tool to supercharge its community-driven marketing campaigns. Each reel they post is filled with energy, drive, and enthusiasm.</p><p id=\"\">Redbull is always one of the first brands to adopt popular Instagram trends and use them to its advantage. Here is one of its most recent reels that has gathered massive attention from its audience.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:779px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"779px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62fb15316481fc31cb968489_U5KIguguTIuaUAYUoC6-YgDNFBlUHQC-ngfLYE-oV7RlJsudfY6J4m2Xkt1z2zeGMQ88aBISZvCD7wsjzTndKAGRMFXmXxiKiISkwWYh3NFNQWUF883PijrYOyEPlSjkV25Ytb7W1e-aQ-BVKG2Yf-g.png\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">5 Tips To Creating Winning Instagram Reels</h2><p id=\"\">It’s no secret that short, focused, and entertaining video clips are taking over social media. Therefore Instagram Reels are a great way for your business to attract attention, boost engagement, and grow your sales.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But this takes much more than recording and uploading a few clips to your business Instagram profile. You need to understand the hacks and what it takes to go viral on Instagram Reels.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Understand How the Algorithm Works</h3><p id=\"\">The success of a Reel is determined by how well you please the all-mighty <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/10-ways-you-can-beat-the-instagram-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram algorithm</a>. No matter what a masterpiece your video clip is, your chances of viral stardom depend solely on the algorithm. These are behind-the-scenes codes that single-handedly decide whether your video is good enough to serve up to the masses or whether it should be buried in obscurity.</p><p id=\"\">Understanding how the algorithm works is crucial&nbsp; to achieving success with Instagram reels. Simple tricks like adding the trending sounds, using the right hashtags, adding captions, and making videos bright and color-popping can help you get more views and engagement from the explore page and reels tab.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Forget About Selling for a Minute</h3><p id=\"\">The truth is, users don’t usually click on reels hoping to see an ad. They may not even be on social media with the intention to discover products or brands. Instead, they’re looking to find new ideas, get educated, make new connections, and most of all, find quick bursts of entertainment to brighten their day.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This is why you need to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/05/17/dont-share-salesy-content-16-smarter-ways-to-lead-prospects-into-the-funnel/\" target=\"_blank\">dump the ‘sales-y’ language</a> and focus on making videos that entertain your audience. Always aim to inform, entertain and delight your audience instead of selling to them. Featuring or emulating UGC is important to maintaining that authentic, non-ad-like video style that performs so well on TikTok and Reels.</p><p id=\"\">This doesn’t mean that your reels shouldn’t be ads. But remember that in most cases, less-sales-y reels perform better than those packed with sales vocabulary.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Consistency is the Key</h3><p id=\"\">Same as with Instagram stories and normal Instagram feeds, consistency is crucial. Posting consistently pleases the Instagram gods — the algorithm — and increases your chances of going viral. However, your main goal shouldn’t necessarily be to “go viral” right away; in the beginning, you should focus more on building up a community of engaged followers over time who are interested in your content. Don’t stress over follower count and views right off the bat.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, posting often can help you figure out which content works and which doesn’t. The more you post, the more you learn about your audience’s tastes and preferences.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Leverage Your Instagram Community</h3><p id=\"\">One of Instagram’s most powerful and underutilized tools is the Instagram community. A recent new feature called Collabs allows you to share credit with other users for posts within the platform. This way, you can share a reel with another creator and allow them to post it on their page as their own.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For instance, as a brand, you can share your reels with influencers, brand partners, and other people in your community, increasing your reach and engagement. Marketing community-first should be your brand’s goal when approaching Instagram Reels, as the content you engage with and reshare from your followers can pave the way for increased reach and even potential <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-an-ambassador-marketing-program-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\">brand ambassadors</a>.</p><p id=\"\">So there you have it. Brands can <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/four-unique-brands-to-learn-from-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\">leverage Instagram</a> Reels to grow their online communities and positively influence sales. Using social content management tools like Pixlee TurnTo, you can maximize this potential and increase your Instagram engagement and conversions tenfold.&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Did you see that viral TikTok video of a chihuahua doing 6 backflips last week? Or the Reel where a guy walks on water…in his living room? Or that hilarious dance challenge on Youtube Shorts that everyone from celebrities like Lizzo to grandparents seems to be doing?</p><p id=\"\">If you’re like most people, the answer is probably yes. And there’s a good reason for that —<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\"> user-generated content</a> (UGC) is taking over the internet, and the world of entertainment, by storm.</p><p id=\"\">In case you’re not familiar with the term, UGC refers to any content – videos, photos, articles, etc. – created by regular, everyday people rather than professional brands and design teams. TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram are just a few of the most popular platforms for UGC. And as social media platforms continue to grow and evolve, UGC will only become more popular too.</p><p id=\"\">Consider TikTok TV; TikTok users can now easily watch TikTok videos — which are primarily UGC — on the big screen, creating an experience that feels like TV streaming and caters to groups.</p><p id=\"\">So what’s behind this UGC phenomenon? Why are people so drawn to videos and photos of regular people doing everyday things? And what does this trend mean for the future of entertainment and ecommerce?</p><h2 id=\"\">Why is UGC So Popular?</h2><p id=\"\">When social media first became a thing, people were hypnotized by glamorous commercials by top brands, celebrities endorsing products on Instagram, or polished social ads from big media companies.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But as social media has evolved, users have become more interested in content that is relatable and real. In other words, they want to see content created by people like them, not professional brands and celebrities.</p><p id=\"\">There are a few reasons for this shift.</p><h3 id=\"\">It Makes the World Feel Smaller and Connected</h3><p id=\"\">Through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and so many others, we can connect with people from all over the world who have similar interests to us. And as we see more people like us creating content that we enjoy, it’s only natural that we would want to create content ourselves.</p><h3 id=\"\">It’s Relatable</h3><p id=\"\">UGC is often more relatable than traditional forms of entertainment. We all know what it means to be dancing in our living room or doing silly challenges with our friends. But we might not relate to a glamorous celebrity endorsement or a big-budget commercial. As the world becomes increasingly uncertain and stressful, UGC provides a much-needed sense of connection and relief.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1570px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1570px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6323b39ce17938bf3b0468ac_Screen%20Shot%202022-09-15%20at%204.21.57%20PM.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">UGC on social media is also a huge driver of word-of-mouth marketing, as users tend to show off the products and brands they love in a genuine, trustworthy way. Instead of highly polished and produced commercials, ads and social posts featuring real people are becoming a major element of brand marketing. More on this later.</p><h3 id=\"\">It’s More Authentic</h3><p id=\"\">In a world where we’re bombarded with fake news and sponsored content, that sense of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/09/13/keeping-it-real-the-importance-of-having-an-authentic-social-media-presence/?sh=128ce8ba110f\" target=\"_blank\">authenticity is more important</a> than ever.</p><p id=\"\">For example, consider the infamous Pepsi commercial featuring Kendall Jenner. The commercial was widely criticized for being tone-deaf and inauthentic. On the other hand, a recent TikTok video by student activist Kailee O’Neill went viral in a matter of hours.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The video’s raw and emotional take on what it’s like to be a teenager today, with the influx of cyberbullying and the destructive nature that social media can have on a person’s self-esteem because of its comparative nature, resonated with many. Which one would you rather watch?</p><h3 id=\"\">It’s Interactive</h3><p id=\"\">UGC on social platforms allows viewers to interact with the content and its creators. For example, TikTok has become known for its challenges, where users create videos of themselves doing a certain task or dance and then challenge their followers to do the same. This level of interactivity is fun and engaging for viewers and makes them feel more connected to the content and its creators.</p><p id=\"\">Many users over the past years have commented on how they feel as if they know the creators of their favorite videos, even though they’ve never actually met them in person. Creators often interact directly with followers, with tools like <a href=\"http://pixlee.com/blog/tiktok-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok stitch and duet</a> fostering this engagement. This level of connection is not possible with traditional forms of entertainment.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Does This Mean for the Future of Entertainment?</h2><p id=\"\">Social media platforms are already giving traditional entertainment giants like streaming services a run for their money. And as more people become interested in creating and sharing content on social media, UGC will only become more influential.</p><p id=\"\">Another huge factor that has led to the widespread prevalence of UGC content is how quickly it can be consumed and how accessible it is. According to Hubspot, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.0001we0wwv7rfeah11k583jclawne\" target=\"_blank\">5% of viewers</a> will stop watching your video after one minute, and 60% will stop watching after two minutes.</p><p id=\"\">This means that people are not as interested in watching long-form content like movies or TV shows as they used to be. They want something quick and easy to consume. Not only that, they don’t want to sit through a long commercial break or wait for a new episode to come out every week. With UGC, they can watch as much or as little as they want, whenever they want.</p><p id=\"\">This is not to say that traditional forms of entertainment will disappear. There will always be a market for big-budget movies and TV shows. But UGC presents a viable alternative – and one that is quickly gaining popularity. It’s only a matter of time before UGC starts to seriously disrupt the traditional entertainment industry.</p><p id=\"\">For brands, this trend presents both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, brands must work harder to stand out in a sea of user-generated content. But on the other hand, they also have the opportunity to connect with consumers in a more authentic and genuine way than ever before.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Can Brands Capitalize on UGC?</h2><p id=\"\">The key for brands is to focus on authenticity and relatability. Rather than compete with user-generated content, they should try to complement it, embrace it as an asset to their content marketing strategies, and take tips from online creators who have excelled at building an engaged audience on social media.</p><h3 id=\"\">UGC Platforms</h3><p id=\"\">UGC platforms like Pixlee TurnTo allow brands to collect, curate, and publish UGC shared online from existing customers, with options to source content through specific hashtags, photo tags, mentions, and more.</p><p id=\"\">If your brand is interested in starting any campaigns around UGC, a content management platform can save you time and effort, and help your brand team access the highest-quality community content.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62f579cf9a71446e754c3f6d_03AMkNkxWsXAZBGAfYuIedDZJ1UrKj7EE9mdiFKGSrx8dtLtsN5mIi1uuA5Cub0IejebM8hDo_WyRExZuN3h8wceYH9Yw_X-_lceVl3WAop7qBG3haHHQGdCc6CdjrBMXLsVlHGjrNY_w9FDvpPY5qw.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">In a similar vein, Pixlee TurnTo’s influencer marketing solution allows brands to discover influencers within their existing fanbases, or partner with new creators and manage campaigns from start to finish in-platform.</p><h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"http://pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer Marketing</a> &amp; UGC Creators</h3><p id=\"\">One way brands can break into the UGC world is by <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/10-influencer-marketing-trends-and-statistics-for-marketers\" target=\"_blank\">partnering with influencers</a> who align with their values and create content that matches their brand identity.</p><p id=\"\">For example, a skincare brand might partner with a beauty influencer who creates videos about natural makeup routines.

Additionally, you can guide them to visit your website and make purchases while you<a href=\"https://www.atlantic.net/pci-compliant-hosting/what-is-pci-compliance/\" target=\"_blank\"> ensure compliance with PCI standards</a> so that all customer financial data is kept encrypted and only shared amongst your employees on a need-to-know basis.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You should also mention that you adhere to the PCI standards for all financial transactions in your <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/types-marketing\" id=\"\">marketing and social media posts</a>, and customers may feel more comfortable buying from you. At the very least, it helps to solidify your business as legitimate and trustworthy.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Repurpose Content With Shoppable Instagram and TikTok</h3><p id=\"\">The best part about UGC is that you can repurpose content across multiple platforms. So if you create a TikTok video that does well, you can also post it as your Instagram story or Reels.</p><p id=\"\">However, you can also take that content’s value further by bringing it into your brand’s marketing strategy outside of social media.

The first is that it has astoundingly<a href=\"https://blog.pixlee.com/instagram-analytics\" target=\"_blank\"> high user enggement</a>; users are happily following and engaging with brands of all types. And since Instagram’s algorithm doesn’t slam business pages the same way that other platforms do in their feed (I’m looking at you, Facebook), you have a much better chance of showing up organically—and easily.</p><p id=\"\">Instagram is also a highly visual platform that isn’t really like any other platform out there.

There are a few best practices to keep in mind, including:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Mention your storefront in every purchasable post.</strong> Every time you have a post that will be displayed in your Instagram storefront and users can purchase from it, mention the storefront in the image’s description.

Without a clear weekly, monthly, and/or quarterly calendar, your social content may not be aligned with your company’s goals, posts may seem sporadic, and your team will likely be faced with more day-to-day content challenges.</p><p id=\"\">Fortunately, most social media apps allow you to schedule future posts and automatically send content to your follower’s feeds. Social media management softwares like <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Emplifi</a> also let you scale your social posting strategy by scheduling content to multiple platforms at once, and view that content in a calendar layout.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">That said, scheduling posts takes careful planning and preparation. Your posts should align with your overall marketing campaign goals and should clearly relate to the KPIs you’ve set.

    "content": "<p>The holiday season is bound to make an impact on your Ecommerce website. According to<a href=\"https://www.disruptiveadvertising.com/ppc/ecommerce/2018-ecommerce-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\"> Disruptive Advertising</a>, 54% of millennials make purchases exclusively online. This data comes at the heels of the nearly <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/27/cyber-monday-sales-7-9-billion-top-record-online-sales-estimate/2123414002/\" target=\"_blank\">$8 billion spent</a> during the 2018 Black Friday Cyber Monday season in the US alone. To compete, Ecommerce businesses do everything they can to differentiate from the crowd. But truth be told, an optimal Ecommerce store design goes a long way. Even if you’re in a code freeze, there are ways you can make impactful adjustments without developer help. Acting now might seem futile, but there’s a lot of benefits you can realize from some simple optimizations.</p><h4><strong>Effects of a Well-Designed Ecommerce Store</strong></h4><p><strong>Easier Content Management</strong>‍</p><p>Even though your design should be customer-centric, you still need to make content management easier for your admins. A well-chosen store design or a theme can help your website stand out due to the sheer clarity of information. Choosing a design that is packed with visual information and hyperlinks confuses the visitors, let alone your content managers. If the content is easier to organize, your customers will have a much better experience going through the product selection afterward.</p><p>‍<strong>Better Online Ranking</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) plays a large role in whether or not a site shows up when someone looks for relevant terms in Google, Bing or Yahoo (among others). According to<a href=\"https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/ecommerce-statistics\" target=\"_blank\"> E-commerce-Platforms</a>, 48% of marketers agree that keyword search and optimization has proven to be a viable tactic in their Ecommerce sites. Putting some thought and effort into your store’s design will net you a much better ranking which leads to online visibility and <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/holiday-shopping-online\" target=\"_blank\">becoming more competitive</a> in the Ecommerce sphere.</p><p>‍<strong>Higher Traffic &amp; Revenue</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Lastly, the most important reason for making sure that your storefront is legible, comfortable and attractive to the customers is for the conversion rates that follow. Keep in mind that people will undoubtedly buy presents and other goodies during the holiday season. The question is, however, which site they will use to do so. Opting for a well-balanced design solution of your e-commerce store will net you far higher traffic and subsequent revenue due to the sheer accessibility and user-friendly nature of your website. Here are five brands that have optimized their sites in unique ways to win this holiday season.</p><p>1. <a href=\"https://www.panasonic.com/global/home.html\">Panasonic</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.panasonic.com/global/home.html\">‍</a>Brand storytelling is an important part of today’s advertising. People connect with brands that have a “heart &amp; soul” component behind the façade. Panasonic does this exceptionally well in their web design. Their website oozes <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-study/panasonic-brand-story-improve-engagement\" target=\"_blank\">brand storytelling</a> from the moment you visit their landing page. The company put an emphasis on their core values first and foremost. Once you are familiar with their “why”, you can approach the “what” through their equally-intuitive Ecommerce store and order whichever item you wish to purchase. The same philosophy can be applied to any brand with only a few written sentences about the reasoning and goals behind the brand name.</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://store.nytimes.com/?ref=ecommdesign\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a></p><p><a href=\"https://store.nytimes.com/?ref=ecommdesign\" target=\"_blank\">‍</a>The famous and world-renown news website also boasts an Ecommerce storefront. What separates The New York Times design from others is its emphasis on dominant typography. This can be an amazing solution for high-end products, Christmas bundles, discount highlights, and other important items. The theme is minimalistic in nature, relying on products themselves to fill in the white space. It features a very clean grid design which can be comfortable to browse through both desktop and mobile devices. </p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.sportsmansguide.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sportsman’s Guide</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sportsmansguide.com/\" target=\"_blank\">‍</a>Covering everything ‘outdoor sports’, including hunting and fishing, The Sportsman’s Guide has quite a lot to offer. Their various products and services require a special type of Ecommerce design for easy navigation. The Sportsman’s Guide puts an emphasis on clear calls to action with bold lettering and clear purchase incentives. You need not look any further than the front page to know about every product available at a steal price. To complement their well-designed storefront, The Sportsman Guide worked to boost engagement rates and build their community with a <a href=\"https://assets.pixlee.com/website/hubspot/pdf/Case-Studies/Sportsmans-Guide-Pixlee-Case-Study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">social media campaign</a>. This move resulted in a resounding success both for their traffic and overall revenue. Combining an impactful landing page full of deals and offers with <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/what-is-a-social-storefront-and-why-do-you-need-one/\" target=\"_blank\">tagging and content sharing</a> can prove to be a very useful tactic in the coming holiday season.</p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.beaconrelief.com/?ref=ecommdesign\" target=\"_blank\">Beacon</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.beaconrelief.com/?ref=ecommdesign\" target=\"_blank\">‍</a>Beacon is a part of a relief fund organization run by a group of professional graphic designers. Their site’s goal is to sell posters and gather money for charities. What makes Beacon stand out is the Ecommerce store design. The website is designed to resemble an art gallery, with posters on the walls around each visitor. You can easily select the product (poster) you like and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/ecommerce-best-practices-to-boost-your-online-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">order it within minutes</a> of your decision. This clean ad-free design helps maintain professional integrity and drives conversion. Beacon’s website is a good example of impeccable visual composition, product placement and product description writing.</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://www.munchkin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Munchkin</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.munchkin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">‍</a>Social proof and testimonials are often sorely lacking across the web. Munchkin’s storefront places a heavy emphasis they place on user-created content (UGC) to help the shopper connect with their products. This baby product company has made it its mission to include happy families and babies into their product sales pages. This has brought a community of families, and parents of young children to the website. This philosophy emphasizes <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-study/munchkin-build-brand-community-brand-experience\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>customer inclusion and social proof</strong></a> in its design. You can easily follow in Munchkin’s footsteps and feature your happy, satisfied customers across the website. Their words will speak louder than any marketing pitch you write in-house. Customers simply identify with everyday people more than they do with abstract company names and logos – a lesson that Ecommerce brands can learn for the holidays.</p><p>‍<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-develop-authentic-ecommerce-brand-drive-holiday-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">The holiday season</a> is closing in quickly with each passing day. People won’t stand for an unintuitive, unfriendly design of online stores with the myriad options they have to choose from. Optimize your site for your customers this season and see the results pour in!</p><p>‍<em>Elisa Abbott is a freelancer whose passion lies in creative writing.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Social media helps us connect with friends, family, and even strangers from halfway around the world. When used right, it can be a great way to nurture healthy relationships with people who share the same interests. However, social media can also breed negativity, which can affect people’s mental health.</p><p id=\"\">For some people, affirmation on social media in the form of likes and comments <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/close-encounters/201610/do-facebook-likes-affect-psychological-well-being\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">can affect self-esteem</a>. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364393/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">several studies</a> have also found a correlation between prolonged social media use and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.That’s why your brand’s role in social media marketing is so critical. As someone who’s in charge of a brand or business social media account, you are responsible for making a positive change in your community. Here are five helpful things you should know about mental health and social media.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1: Understand the Need for Positive Messaging</strong></h2><p id=\"\">With easy access to information, social media has become <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/11/key-findings-about-the-online-news-landscape-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">one of the top channels to get news</a>. Yet the constant stream of negative news and content could have a harmful impact on mental health. And the trouble is that it still affects you, even if you’re consuming the content passively while scrolling through your feed.</p><p id=\"\">Constantly seeing disaster or sensational reporting <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/is-watching-the-news-bad-for-mental-health-4802320\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">can elevate stress levels</a> and trigger anxiety and sleeping problems. What this means is you need to carefully plan your content so as not to add to the information overload.</p><p id=\"\">You could make a difference by bringing in some positive messaging in the middle of all the negative content. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t talk about pressing issues or current events at all. It just means that you should find a way to add a positive or inspirational twist to the topic.</p><p id=\"\">For instance, you can ask your community what their favorite parts about working from home are, share the best ways to use your product or service while quarantining, or amplify positive posts like new job announcements or personal news to celebrate others. Giveaways and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media contests</a> are also great ways to promote your brand while maintaining a positive attitude online.</p><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"https://www.psseasoning.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">PS Seasoning</a> shares delicious photos and recipe ideas to inspire its cooking community on Instagram.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637218d10ba01801c36aba27_1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2: Build a Strong, Inclusive Community With UGC</strong></h2><p id=\"\">With people craving affirmation through social media, it’s no surprise that many of them try to emulate social media perfection. So, we see people with perfect bodies and flawless skin living an enviable lifestyle of travel and luxurious experiences. Constantly seeing this type of content can trigger social media envy and fear of missing out in many people. This can then have an impact on their self-esteem. A <a href=\"https://www.cureus.com/articles/31508-social-media-use-and-its-connection-to-mental-health-a-systematic-review\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">systematic review of 16 papers</a> even found that social media envy can lead to stress anxiety and depression.</p><p id=\"\">This is why your role as a social media marketer should also involve <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/digital-brand-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">nurturing a strong and inclusive community</a> by sharing <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) from your brand community. Make room for real people and their real experiences, including all their flaws and imperfections. The goal is to showcase and celebrate the real people out there, not just the “perfect” influencers and celebrities. This can help you build a positive community that’s inclusive of everyone regardless of race, sexuality, or body type. Brands that <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/5-times-brands-used-user-generated-content-to-build-inclusivity/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">make the most of UGC</a> often use branded hashtags, contests, and online inspiration galleries to encourage their customers to share on social media how they use those products or services. Check out these <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-ads\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content examples</a> to begin creating a UGC campaign strategy that inspires your audience to participate &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.milanicosmetics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Milani Cosmetics</a> uses its Instagram page to highlight real customers and influencers of diverse skin types and backgrounds instead of focusing just on professional, edited photos of models. This makes the brand’s posts feel more authentic and relatable to customers scrolling through their feeds, and produces a welcoming, genuine atmosphere within the Milani’s community. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637219734e90e47f1c87de07_2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3: Leave No Room for Trolling and Bullying</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Creating and nurturing a positive community also means protecting the community from those who aim to harass its members.With easy access to the channel, social media makes room for all types of people – including bullies and trolls. These are people who tend to spread negativity with hurtful comments and posts. You can bet that this type of behavior can cause mental health issues or trigger existing symptoms for the victim. It can be particularly tough on teenagers. <a href=\"https://jebmh.com/assets/data_pdf/Vidushi_Singh_-_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">A study on 150 students</a> between the ages of 16 and 18 brings light to the seriousness of this problem. The study found that 67% of those who were trolled experienced depression.</p><p id=\"\">To make matters worse, <a href=\"https://www.meganmeierfoundation.org/statistics\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">those who experience bullying or cyberbullying can experience</a> anxiety, low self-esteem, academic difficulties, suicidal thoughts, and many more. Not to mention, students who experience bullying or cyberbullying are almost twice as likely to attempt suicide. It’s crucial that you adopt a “no tolerance” policy when it comes to this type of behavior. Use <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-free-hashtag-analytics-tools-that-every-brand-needs/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media listening</a> tools to keep a close eye on your audience. Look for any harmful comments and uses of flagged keywords to remove bullies and trolls from your community. The idea is to protect the mental health of your community by blocking out users who could harm them. This can only help nourish trust between your brand and its community members.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4: Openly Discuss Mental Health to End the Stigma</strong></h2><p id=\"\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">World Health Organization</a>, 264 million people suffer from depression globally. Bipolar disorder, for instance, affects about 45 million people worldwide, while schizophrenia and other psychoses affect 20 million.</p><p id=\"\">This means that you never really know who’s struggling with a mental health disorder within your community or your organization. Moreover, it doesn’t help that negative social media experiences can fuel these symptoms. In fact, for every <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2019/01/24/loneliness-linked-to-negative-social-media-experiences-study-finds/?sh=5d552c027afe\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">10% rise in negative social media experiences</a>, the risk of depression increased by 20%. And every 10% rise in negative social media experiences increased loneliness by 13%.</p><p id=\"\">This makes it crucial to openly talk about mental health issues through your brand’s social media at every valid opportunity. Talk openly about struggles with mental health issues by sharing stories and resources that could help those who are struggling. Provide your audiences with encouragement and inspiration through your posts, and do everything you can to make them feel included and comfortable as members of your brand’s community.</p><p id=\"\">The idea is to make them realize that they’re not alone so that they don’t feel too lonely or isolated. And this could have an impact on their social media experiences and eventually, their mental health.For instance, Refinery 29 shared some tips on how to hold on to the lessons learned in 2020. The tips were largely based on self-care and mental wellness.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:606px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"606px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637219a350fb8e246fc3256e_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CJgxD_XJ4KK/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Image Source</a></p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5: It Affects You, Too</strong></h2><p id=\"\">While you’re busy taking care of everyone else’s mental health, don’t forget your own. Social media marketers and business owners are not impervious to social media. According to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2018/07/30/5-ways-to-overcome-online-social-media-fatigue-for-mental-well-being/?sh=3b1eacac1cfa\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">survey by Dr. Pragya Agarwal</a>, 80% of SMEs experienced stress and panic about their social media.</p><p id=\"\">These feelings resulted from the pressure to be perfect and to keep up with the constantly changing technology. The endless struggle to gain more followers as well as the need to connect with influencers were also major causes.</p><p id=\"\">It’s crucial to take care of your mental health first, and promote mental wellness with your marketing efforts. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-brands-can-approach-authenticity-diversity-and-pride/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Prioritize authenticity</a> to nourish yourself and your community, and seek out an <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a> solution that reduces your own workload. Also, don’t let your busy job get to your head. Use social media tools at your disposal to save you time and make you feel more confident and competent in your job.</p><p id=\"\">Along with its many benefits, social media comes with its fair share of drawbacks. As a social media marketer, it’s up to you to protect your community and promote positivity for better mental health.

    "content": "<p>Thanks to the professional-grade cameras on even the most basic smartphones, it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/10913/number-of-photos-taken-worldwide/\">1.2 trillion photos were taken last year</a>, and much of this content features a product or experience provided by the brands they love. These photos and videos invariably end up posted on <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-prove-your-social-media-efforts-affect-business-goals/\">social media</a> and saved in users’ camera rolls, which has not only created an incredible opportunity for brands, it has changed the landscape of digital marketing.</p><p>User-generated content equips marketing teams with one of their most powerful weapons in the quest for conversions: the voice of their customers. Since customers are already creating this visual content, brands can give them the opportunity to showcase how they use the products and offer powerful social proof to their peers. Brands can and should seize the opportunity to leverage user-generated content to bring in more revenue, cut down their content creation expenses, and form a deeper connection with customers.</p><h2>Increase Revenue</h2><p>User-generated Content is especially powerful during the consideration phase of the buyer’s journey because it provides the necessary social proof to legitimize the product or experience, which has the power to turn browsers into buyers. When given the chance to interact with UGC, <a href=\"https://assets.pixlee.com/website/hubspot/pdf/Case-Studies/KiraGrace-Pixlee-Case-Study.pdf\">shoppers convert at a rate of 2x on average</a>. This stems from a change in the culture of commerce – consumers no longer inherently trust brands. What used to be a “nice-to-have” tool in a marketer’s toolbox, word-of-mouth marketing has been infinitely amplified in today’s digital age. Companies can harness the power of the conversations that their fans are already having and share them with potential customers to build legitimacy. If a shopper interacts with customer photos, they spend an average of <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-study/panasonic-brand-story-improve-engagement\">120% more time on the site</a>. Shoppers who spend more time on a site tend to discover new products and are more inclined to add those items to the cart.</p><p>One of the largest opportunities for user-generated content lies in abandoned cart email campaigns. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/use-photos-from-social-media-to-combat-abandoned-shopping-carts/\">Companies lost $120 million</a> in potential revenue last year to abandoned shopping carts. Reasons range from simply being unsure to issues with the checkout process and unexpected shipping charges, but brands who add UGC to those abandoned cart campaigns are able to <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/use-photos-from-social-media-to-combat-abandoned-shopping-carts/\">recover 7%</a> of that revenue.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:768px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"768px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628ced4e76ac3e672d45420b_ALO-YOGA-MULTPILE-PRODUCTS-768x453.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Photos and videos featuring multiple products can be tagged with each product, which has been shown to <a href=\"https://assets.pixlee.com/website/hubspot/pdf/Case-Studies/KiraGrace-Pixlee-Case-Study.pdf\">increase average order value by 6%.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Decrease Content Cost</h2><p>Content creation is one of the largest pieces of a brand’s marketing budget, professional photographers charge anywhere from <a href=\"http://www.roshsillars.com/2017/02/15/much-photographers-charge-2017/\">$250 to &nbsp;$1,500 per asset</a>. The goal of these assets is to reach a target audience with the right message at the right time in hopes of inspiring a purchase, but it’s nearly impossible to know if an image will actually resonate with customers before making that investment . Keeping up with the demand for fresh content for each customer touchpoint can be overwhelming and pricy for brands. &nbsp;Instead of relying solely on professional photoshoots, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-study/sportsmans-guide-scale-content-social-media-marketing-campaign\">companies can realize significant cost savings by incorporating user-generated content into their marketing campaigns</a>. This UGC is not only a free asset, but brands can be sure that it will resonate with their target audience because it <em>came from</em> that audience. When utilizing a user-generated content marketing platform like <a href=\"http://www.pixlee.com/\">Pixlee</a>, brands gain access to an <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/future-ugc-owned/307322/\">endless supply of effective content</a> that's easy to find, manage, and distribute across all web properties. This allows for the distribution of high-performing content at an unprecedented scale.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:768px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"768px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628ced4d0b1cea4507362c2a_Analytics-Center-768x320.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2>Connect With Customers</h2><p>Brands are on an ever-evolving quest to better understand and build relationships with their customers. The best way to do this is through authentic 1:1 interactions. With user-generated content, brands have the opportunity to open a direct dialogue with highly engaged customers at multiple touchpoints along the customer journey. By seeking out passionate customers and sharing their content, brands are able to create a community of brand advocates and better understand what resonates with their target audience. If done correctly, this feedback loop can go a long way to improving marketing campaigns, informing product decisions, and driving customer engagement.</p><p>When brands are paying attention and leveraging the opportunity to connect with customers, they are able to discover and amplify this customer voice. Companies may find that their customers come up with unexpected use cases for their products or create a surprising viral movement. With a little encouragement, these highly-engaged customers soon become vocal advocates for the brand, happily sharing their experiences with their followers, which increases brand awareness and creates the opportunity to turn their friends and followers into the brand’s newest customers.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:768px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"768px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628ced4e29de722142be8496_permissioning-768x514.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong>Seamless Omni-Channel Experience</strong>The user-generated content opportunity for marketers cannot be overstated. Brands that capitalize on this opportunity continue to see increased revenue, decreased content costs, and are able to connect with customers in an authentic way. The use of UGC throughout the ecosystem of social media, mobile web, email, mobile applications, and in-store displays creates a seamless omni-channel experience for customers and fosters a brand-customer relationship that will encourage loyalty and repeat purchases for years to come.</p><p>To learn more about how you can capitalize on the marketing power or user-generated content, contact Pixlee today!</p>",

By working with them this way, you can ensure a mutually profitable partnership and build long-term relationships.</p><h3 id=\"\">2) Ditch Spreadsheets for an Influencer CRM</h3><p id=\"\">Streamline your influencer management strategy by utilizing an <a href=\"https://pixlee.webflow.io/solutions-page-influencer-marketing\" id=\"\">influencer marketing platform</a> like Pixlee’s. Not only does this allow you to create and manage relationships in one place, but you can also discover new potential influencers to partner with and keep track of every individual you have worked with for future reference. Additionally, Pixlee gives you the ability to collect, schedule, and publish influencer content like Instagram stories and posts directly within the platform. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:861px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"861px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2aadb3c7bc596a6ee114_image1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Brands like Alo Yoga, KiraGrace, and Levain Bakery managing multiple influencers and thousands of content assets save time, effort, and money by using Pixlee’s CRM to make influencer management an integrated source of content for all campaigns.</p><h3 id=\"\">3) Give Influencers Creative Freedom</h3><p id=\"\">Influencers lend your brand a unique voice that resonates with a fanbase they have carefully grown over time. Each creator’s community of engaged users identifies with that unique voice of the influencer, so any campaign that sounds forced or branded will likely not appear genuine to those followers.</p><p id=\"\">Give your influencers the “what” of your campaign message, but allow them creative liberty when crafting the “how.” A winning influencer campaign is one that puts influencers on the center stage to showcase your brand’s respect for the creator.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1492px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1492px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2abfa50d810a6bc94316_image1-copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">In this Instagram post, yogi @wanderwithwu shares Alo Yoga content while adding a unique pose list in the caption catered to her followers.</p><h3 id=\"\">4) Define and Measure Campaign Success</h3><p id=\"\">You should agree on a set of metrics you will measure before you launch your campaign. You might track the number of clicks, comments, conversions, or shares. This is where a CRM platform comes in handy yet again; keep track of top metrics from social engagement to ROI, and learn what’s working best in your partnerships.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1077px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1077px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2abf72c388cc33b8be64_image6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Once your campaign is launched, track the performance and the resulting engagement of each influencer. By tracking the performance over time, you’ll see what kind of promotion and products are working best. That will help you identify which influencers you want to continue working with.</p><p id=\"\">You should share the results of your campaign with influencers, especially if you’re measuring metrics like sales, or subscribers. Influencers don’t always get access to this data, and it’s good for them to know how much value they bring to a business.</p><h3 id=\"\">5) Compensate Your Influencers Properly</h3><p id=\"\">Make sure you give your influencers what they’re due. If that’s monetary compensation, you should know the <a href=\"https://nealschaffer.com/how-much-to-pay-influencer/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">factors that influence influencer rates</a>. Discuss a budget with your influencers before the start of the campaign.</p><p id=\"\">There is, however, more than one way to go about compensation when it comes to influencer management (that is, assuming it was mutually agreed on).</p><p id=\"\">You can simultaneously work with different things when working with them. For instance, instead of paying them cash, consider the following: </p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Free samples and giveaways if they already like/ buy your brand and then tagging them as natural <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-ways-ambassador-marketing-can-benefit-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand ambassadors</a>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Special offers and insider access, in case you just want to get started with them and they also show interest in your product.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Invites to special events</li></ul><p id=\"\">Also, share the results of your campaign with them. Tell them if they made you money or had the impact you desired. Let them know if they underperformed for improvement and be willing to reward them if they over-delivered.In a nutshell, influencer management is about nurturing creator relationships the right way. It also involves setting clear expectations and rewards, letting their creative juices flow, and tracking campaign results. By applying these insights to your campaigns, you can achieve your desired campaign results. You can build long-term relationships with your influencers, too, who will, in the end, prove to be a business asset for you. </p><p id=\"\">‍<em id=\"\">By Chris Norton, Founder of insight-led PR agency </em><a href=\"https://prohibitionpr.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Prohibition</em></a><em id=\"\">, and </em><a href=\"https://www.socialmediatraining.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Social Media Training</em></a><em id=\"\">, former University lecturer, author of “Share This Too” and listed in the UK's top 10 PR and social media bloggers.</em></p>",

It has played a pivotal role in increasing brand reach and transformed how brands position themselves. The top industries using Instagram have many strategies in common, especially when it comes to community-driven content.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The top industries using <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram marketing</a> today are fashion, food, travel, beauty and skincare, and real estate.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Fashion Industry</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It would be safe to say that Instagram is dominated by the fashion world.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Magazines and billboards are no longer consumers’ main sources of fashion inspiration Today, anything that’s trending on Instagram in terms of fashion creates a bandwagon effect. Approximately <a href=\"https://www.fashiongonerogue.com/how-instagram-models-are-influencing-the-fashion-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">50%</a> of Instagram users engage with and follow accounts in this niche to discover new brands, buy products, and find outfit inspiration.

Food Industry</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Food and Instagram are a match made in heaven. When was the last time you took a food picture for the gram before gorging on it?&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">From fast-food giants to vegan food bloggers, all micro-niches are having their piece of cake. As per a <a href=\"https://blog.digimind.com/en/trends/instagram-key-global-figures-2019\" id=\"\">study</a> in 2019, “Food fans connect to Instagram an average of 18 times a day.”</p><p id=\"\">As aesthetically pleasing and appetizing food photos have ruled Instagram, brands and individuals have shifted the needle to more behind-the-scenes storytelling, foodie <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a> collaborations, and, perhaps most notably, <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC).&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c5f9946803785b8e68b75f_image1%20copy.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Starting out as a local bake shop in New York, Levain Bakery is now a globally known brand, boasting hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers.

Travel Industry</strong></h3><p id=\"\">A recent <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/instagram-effect-travel-ecommerce-marketing-airbnb-easyjet/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">survey</a> found that as much as 40% of Instagram users under the age of 30 have prioritized the “Instagrammability” of the destinations before they plan a trip or make any purchasing decisions. Vacationers these days aren’t just looking for a good experience — they also want an experience catered to sharing on the ‘gram.</p><p id=\"\">The impact of Instagram on the travel industry has been so profound that almost everyone has become an ambassador of the trips they take and the places they visit. Successful travel influencers are even able to build careers off of traveling to new destinations and Instagramming their vacays.</p><p id=\"\">As audiences consume content from everyday consumers and their favorite influencers sharing content from their travels on Instagram, companies in the travel industry have grown their presences on Instagram. Destinations like Kimpton Hotels and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas partner with ambassadors and influencers to take advantage of this phenomenon, often resharing their content on the brand’s Instagram account.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c5f9a6114bd7407b037fbe_image7.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/10-travel-influencers-your-brand-should-partner-with/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Travel influencers</a> often take advantage of branded hashtags and mention the travel brands featured in their posts. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas uses Pixlee TurnTo</a> to harness this high-quality community content, driving over 250 million impressions on social media and the brand’s site.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Beauty and Skincare Industry</strong></h3><p id=\"\">From social media marketing to influencers, the beauty and skincare industry took over Instagram way before others joined the bandwagon. In the year 2020, <a href=\"https://www.kolsquare.com/en/blog/5-inspiring-influencer-campaigns-in-the-beauty-sector-in-2021%20\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">90% of Instagram posts were by beauty brands</a>. Clearly, Instagram is the No.1 platform for brand awareness for beauty brands.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Similarly to the fashion industry, integration options like a <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/shoppable-instagram-101/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">shoppable Instagram feed</a> have become popular in the beauty community. From IGTV and reels to stories and static posts, these brands make the most of their Instagram usage both on and off the app.</p><p id=\"\">Glossier’s brand ambassador program across Instagram massively contributed to its success. The company chose beauty influencers within the beauty niche that had a good amount of influence over their followers. Glossier offered them discounts through their reps, and each time someone placed an order through them— they’d make a small commission. Many other successful beauty&nbsp; brands have picked up this <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-setup-and-run-an-ecommerce-referral-program/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ecommerce referral program</a> approach on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Affordable, vegan, and transparent skincare brands are too making their mark on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Coming to trends and transparent skincare, K-beauty or Korean beauty is dominating the Instagram world. Wondering why? As per Korean tradition, their skin-care regime only constitutes natural and chemical-free ingredients and gives that glowy-dewy look that is trending in the beauty world. Korean skin-care routines do not just constitute a product or two. Typically they have 7-step processes, which adds to their popularity.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/62c5f9b65d6d0893018b8972_image6.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">K-beauty powerhouse MBX uses Pixlee TurnTo across its five different brand accounts on Instagram, often resharing UGC to resonate with its diverse and engaged audience.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5.

Social media sits next to referrals when it comes to obtaining listings. Since home selling is a visual process, Instagram fits in perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">One might wonder how an industry like real estate is flourishing on a platform dominated by millennials. The National Association of Homebuilders conducted a study on homeownership, and the findings were startling, to say the least.

Informal brand ambassadors are anyone who loves your business, enjoys your products, and promotes you for free simply because they are loyal customers. Employing a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\">user-generated content platform</a> like Pixlee’s helps you collect, permission, and publish community content quickly, and allows your brand customizability when creating widgets and social posts for your site.

They know your business, are already connected with it, and have the professional experience to do that job. Even if they have a small following on social media, their contribution will be valuable because they can introduce your brand from the inside.

    "content": "<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Influencer marketing</a> is one of the most effective ways for brands to ignite community engagement and drive sales. When launching and promoting a product or a brand, marketers often ask, \"How should I reward an influencer for participation in our campaign?\" Mostly, they get fuzzy data because paying for influencer advertising is not heavily regulated. Ultimately, influencer pay is influenced by a multitude of factors. Many influencers will accept different forms of compensation. But which are the most common and how should you go about <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">paying influencers</a> for their work? First, you need to look at the factors that often contribute to an influencer’s pay rate.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Affects the Influencer’s Rate </h2><p id=\"\">In order to properly calculate the price you can offer an influencer you’ve decided to work with, it is important to understand what can affect the rates and what are the ways of rewarding Internet stars. </p><h3 id=\"\">Number of Followers and Their Engagement Level</h3><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://acodez.in/types-of-social-media-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Influencers are usually categorized</a> by the number of subscribers or followers:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Mega Influencers and Celebrity Influencers (more than 1 million followers)</li><li id=\"\">Macro Influencers (100,000 to 1 million followers)</li><li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/how-to-find-micro-influencers-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Micro-Influencers</a> (1,000 to 100,000 followers).</li></ul><p id=\"\">An <a href=\"https://landing.pixlee.com/pixlee-for-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing CRM platform</a> can significantly reduce the time and effort required to find and manage the right influencers for your brand. With Pixlee’s CRM platform, you can discover the most engaging influencers of various sizes and industries without having to do it manually. After discovering the right influencers, you can easily manage and measure campaigns to determine the value of all influencer activities and access all influencer content in one location. </p><p id=\"\">At first glance, the number of followers seems to be the most important point when choosing an influencer for cooperation. After all, the more people are following a blogger - the more users will see an integration with your brand. This is true and untrue at the same time.</p><p id=\"\">Of course, the cost of a sponsored publication on a blog with millions of followers will be higher than in an account with ten thousand followers. But the cost of ad integration can also vary between Influencers with the same number of followers. This is because other metrics like engagement rate must be factored into your rate. Take a look at some of the top <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-top-influencer-marketing-kpis/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketing KPIs</a> that you should be aware of.</p><p id=\"\">Social media managers used to chase the number of followers. Today, everyone is interested in the quality of the audience and engagement. These are key indicators that directly affect the ranking of posts in the smart feed. Engagement is also determined by the speed of <a href=\"https://buzzvoice.com/instagram/likes/order?\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">getting likes</a>, social networks track this. </p><p id=\"\">Simply put, a million passive and disloyal followers are valued much less than a million loyal users who are waiting for new posts, actively commenting, liking, etc. Therefore, in order to properly assess the cost of services, it is necessary to ask the Influencer to provide analytics of his profile.</p><p id=\"\">Micro-influencers often have more engaged audiences because they've <a href=\"http://www.pixlee.com/blog/7-tools-to-become-a-better-influencer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">become an influencer</a> in niche areas, leading their followers to trust the brands and products they recommend. Pixlee’s influencer marketing platform allows you to see engagement rate, followers, and other metrics so you can compare between influencers within the platform.</p><p id=\"\">Followers trust the average bloggers or micro-influencers, as they believe that they are not yet “spoiled” with advertising offers and are more careful in selecting them. This is another reason why the number of subscribers is not the most important aspect when choosing a person to represent your brand or service online. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/micro-influencer-outreach-how-to-find-retain-and-empower-micro-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">82% of consumers</a> stated that they would be highly likely to follow recommendations made by a micro-influencer.</p><h3 id=\"\">Creativity and Talent </h3><p id=\"\">The more creative your integration is, the more it will cost. To make an imaginative one-minute video for Instagram or <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/tiktok-marketing-strategies-for-brands/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tik Tok</a>, creators need to spend a few hours to come up with an idea, maybe buy the necessary attributes, film it, edit, etc. Let alone full-length video projects for YouTube, the creation of which can take weeks or even months. </p><p id=\"\">The price will often vary between different creators. Each creator approaches content in their own unique way based on what they enjoy and what their subscribers want to see. Moreover, different creators have different needs - some may need video equipment and editing experience while others may only need a phone with an internet connection. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Makeup brand influencers from brands like Morphe are an example of influencers taking their own creative approaches to promote products. The influencer is the one who decides what look they’re going to do, how they’re going to make and edit their content, and ultimately how that content is presented to their audience.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1329px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1329px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ae417ac06639626147f_Screen-Shot-2021-10-18-at-2.10.18-AM-e1634868101466.png\" alt=\"morphe influencer creative approach \" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Of course, in this aspect, it's difficult to calculate even approximate amounts because it all depends on the complexity of the project, the effort and time spent by an influencer for its creation, and the specifics of the selected social network. </p><h3 id=\"\">Long-Term Integration<strong id=\"\"> </strong></h3><p id=\"\">The pricing is also affected by the long-term nature of the marketing campaign. Are you planning on reusing the content in different channels and for a one-time activation? Or will the influencer campaign extend beyond the initial &nbsp;In the end, a long-term partnership will be more profitable than a single post? It's like buying wholesale and retail but in the realities of the social media sphere. </p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pixlee</a> allows you to maintain influencer campaigns within the platform so you can reference them at any time and manage relationships with past influencers you might want to work with again.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, the \"life\" of your integration on the influencer's account also has a direct impact on the final cost of the services (the longer the post will \"live\" on the blog - the more the customer will pay). </p><p id=\"\">But that's not all, there is another aspect: if brand owners do not want the Influencer to create integrations with direct competitors of the brand in the next 2-3 months after publication, they will also pay extra for this service. </p><h2 id=\"\">How to Reward Influencers </h2><p id=\"\">There are 4 basic types of reward and incentive programs:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">In cash</li><li id=\"\">Paying commission (<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-setup-and-run-an-ecommerce-referral-program/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Affiliate Marketing</a>)</li><li id=\"\">Presenting a product/service</li><li id=\"\">Cash + presenting a product/service. </li></ul><p id=\"\">The most attractive option for Influencers, of course, is payments in cash equivalent. Therefore, we will take a closer look at this one first. </p><h3 id=\"\">Rewarding in Cash</h3><p id=\"\">When it comes to paying influencers for posting your product or brand, different social media platforms have different rates of compensation, with Instagram’s being the highest. Influencers’ rates are usually dependent on follower counts or engagement rates.</p><p id=\"\">Determining a base price typically starts with <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-influencer-rates/#How_to_calculate_fair_Instagram_influencer_rates\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">these standard formulas</a> and can increase from there based on supplemental factors.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Engagement rate per post + extras for type of post (x # of posts) + extra factors = total rate. &nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li id=\"\">$100 per 10,000 followers + extras for type of post (x # of posts) + additional factors = total rate.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Based on these formulas, the compensation for influencer content on Instagram could align with this scale:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">0 to 100,000 followers: $2,000 or less</li><li id=\"\">100,000 to 1,000,000 followers: $5,000 to $10,000</li></ul><p id=\"\">While it’s useful to know how much you should be paying your influencers for their posts during a campaign based on follower count, it shouldn’t be the only factor. You should also pay influencers for the quality of their content, which can later be used for other channels and continue to provide value to your brand beyond the length of the campaign.</p><p id=\"\">It is important to note that these numbers are approximate based on standard formulas. Compensation for individual posts can vary widely between influencers of all sizes. </p><p id=\"\">When calculating, you can rely on these figures, but do not forget about other aspects affecting the price described above. If your integration is imaginative and requires a lot of time for creation - take it into account, as well as the \"life\" of the post/video on the influencer's account.</p><h3 id=\"\">Commission (Affiliate Marketing)</h3><p id=\"\">Affiliate marketing is on the rise. With more brands looking for cost-effective strategies to reach their target audience, we continue to see an increase in the use of affiliate marketing to promote products. The U.S. affiliate marketing industry’s annual spending is projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/693438/affiliate-marketing-spending/#statisticContainer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">$8.2 billion by 2022</a>, a nearly 3 billion dollar increase since 2017. &nbsp; It may be acceptable for micro-bloggers, but macro-influencers will most likely not agree to cooperate on such terms. Why not? Let's take a closer look.</p><p id=\"\">First, it all depends on the sales of a brand. Brand owners should be confident that their product will be sold well enough to make a reasonable amount of money for the influencer.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, commission with influencers typically comes from a unique discount code your brand gives to an influencer, who then makes a commission on the sales they directly bring in using that code. </p><p id=\"\">Morphe is one of many brands that gives its influencers a discount code to offer to their followers to receive a percentage off of their purchase.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:818px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"818px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ae4a38b7a4b98d270aa_VICRAM-morphe-discount-code-copy.jpeg\" alt=\"Morphe discount code\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">This method may also have some technical inconveniences to overcome without the right affiliate tracking tools in place.</p><h3 id=\"\">Barter Collaboration </h3><p id=\"\">Another way to reward an Influencer is to provide a brand product or a service for free.</p><p id=\"\">It goes like this: a brand provides some of its best products to the influencer absolutely for free, the influencer tests products and shares his/her opinion about it on the blog. In this case, the brand owners get advertising on a barter basis. By bartering, a blogger can get anything: from a service (a visit to a beauty salon, entertainment event, etc.) to a product (cosmetics, appliances, household items, etc.).</p><p id=\"\">It should be noted that micro-bloggers work on a barter basis more often. For macro-bloggers, brands probably have to offer something more. This could include free product samples, access to exclusive products before the official launch, invitations to VIP events, or perhaps even let them do a giveaway with exclusive products for their followers.</p><h3 id=\"\">Product and Cash</h3><p id=\"\">Unlike the previous method of rewarding the influencer, this option will work for both micro-and macro-bloggers. </p><p id=\"\">In this case, in addition to a product for review, the opinion leader also gets paid in cash. This and the previous method are great because an influencer has the opportunity to test the product well before expressing an opinion about it. Such reviews are much more valuable for followers because they are more objective and honest. </p><p id=\"\">Also, the Influencer has the right to refuse advertising after receiving the product. This happens when the product turns out to be of poor quality or even dangerous, and the blogger values the trust of his followers and is <a href=\"https://reply.io/online-reputation-management\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">worried about his/her reputation</a>. </p><p id=\"\">There are many ways to approach influencer compensation. While many may prefer a direct cash <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/invoice-templates/freelancers\" target=\"_blank\">payment for their work</a>, passionate fans and micro-influencers may be open to creating content in exchange for exclusivity.</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Dmytro Sokhach is an entrepreneur and the 6-Figure Flipper Club member.

    "content": "<p>Marketing on social media is not a personal choice anymore. With almost 4 billion combined active users of various social media platforms, the audience present on these platforms is simply too big to be ignored from a marketing perspective.</p><p>Naturally, the demand for social media marketing as a service has skyrocketed, and so has the number on the attached price tag. Sure, there are many cheap options available, but that’s all they are, cheap. Agencies and consultants that cut corners and offer “affordable” social media marketing strategies rarely deliver results. Moreover, if not handled by someone who cares about your brand and knows what they are doing, bad marketing on social media can actually hurt the sales numbers you are already producing.</p><p>As a result, many small business owners are forced to DIY their <a href=\"https://www.digitalwebsolutions.com/influencers-other-marketing-hacks-to-unlock-social-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">social media marketing</a>. &nbsp;When social media is not a core competency or able to be prioritized, mastering the art of turning <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/social-media-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">engagements</a> to sales on these channels can be a demanding task Even those who put in consistent effort may not be able to see results. In fact, if you post consistently but the content you put out doesn’t align with your audience, you may end up losing your hard-earned followers.</p><p>With that said, almost every problem with your social media marketing can be solved by building a better understanding of the audience you are targeting.</p><p>In this article, we will be focusing on the reasons why you may be losing social media followers on your brand accounts. We will also be discussing how you can slow down and gradually stop this trend. Without further delay, let’s start looking at the various reasons and how they can be fixed:</p><p>‍<strong>Reason #1: An Incomplete Profile</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Besides being business owners and marketers, most of us are also consumers of various products and services. Chances are, you also follow a number of brands on your preferred social media channels.If you do, open up your preferred social media app and check out the brand profiles that you personally follow. You may notice a trend in all those profiles, that they are all filled to the brim with information about the brand, including a website, aesthetically-pleasing profile and cover photos, and a defined theme in each of their consistent posts.There is a reason that every successful brand's social media profile is ‘complete’, and it is quite simple; it communicates professionalism.</p><p>On the other hand, an ‘incomplete’ profile with a missing profile photo or a poorly cropped cover image, for example, screams unprofessionalism. As a consumer, would you engage with or purchase from a brand that doesn’t even care enough to upload two photos to their own profile and write a well-thought-out bio?</p><p>‍<strong>Solution: </strong>The solution here is obvious. Write a brilliant bio for your brand profiles and upload a professional profile photo and cover image. Put your website in your <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-instagram-bio\" target=\"_blank\">bio</a>, follow related accounts, and don’t forget to add any info pertinent to your brand.</p><p>Making sure both the images are satisfactory (to you) and professional will pay off in the long term when you don’t have to change your profile photo at a later stage. Doing so will confuse your followers and some may even click the ‘unfollow’ button because you changed your profile photo.</p><p>‍<strong>Reason #2: Your Audience isn’t Aligned with Your Brand</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>You can expect a normal ebb and flow of followers—as long as that number is overall trending up, your audience is still connected to your brand. But if you see that number dip, there’s a good chance that you need to branch out and attract more people who are aligned with your brand’s mission and values. &nbsp;Quality followers are always worth more than quantity, though. &nbsp;After all, buying <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/3-ways-to-check-if-your-brand-influencer-has-fake-followers/\" target=\"_blank\">fake followers</a> is not just against the rules, it adds literally no value to your business.</p><p>The other popular way for beginners, especially brands, to quickly gain more followers is with a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/social-photo-contests-and-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\">social media contest</a>. Truth be told, this is an excellent strategy to boost awareness of your brand within your community and gain valuable, authentic <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) in the process. Later, we will touch on how you can repurpose this UGC for marketing campaigns after a contest ends.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1632px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1632px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a2a2dde1ff5e5063b07_image2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://trade.brewedbyhand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brewed By Hand</a> via Best Coffee encouraged its community to share their home coffee setups on Instagram or through a direct upload for the chance to win a new machine and specialty pods.Offer discounts, prizes like gift cards or free swag, or even a simple feature on your brand’s account, and users will be incentivized to enter. It works like a charm almost every single time, and most brands that employ this strategy end up with a hefty boost in their social media following after the contest is finished.</p><p>Sometimes, users will only follow your account to engage in your contest, and unfollow after it comes to a close. If you recently hosted a contest on your social media handles, and are now losing followers all of a sudden, this might be the reason. &nbsp;So how can you combat this?</p><p>‍<strong>Solution: Choose what you are giving away carefully.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Identify what kind of prizes would be most valuable to your niche community, whether it be a membership over multiple months or a discount code, and get your audience excited for future social contests. This way, instead of unfollowing your brand after the contest ends, your community will continue to be interested in future contests, and will engage with other content you share in the meantime.</p><p>‍<strong>Reason #3: Not Posting The Right Content</strong>Saying that you are losing followers because you are not posting the right content can mean many things, and in this section, we will discuss all of them.</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Too much promotional content</strong></li></ul><p>In a survey conducted by <a href=\"https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/reasons-brands-get-unfollowed-social-media\" target=\"_blank\">Goodfirms</a>, too much promotional content was among the top ten reasons people unfollow a brand.</p><p>‍<strong>Solution: </strong>When marketing a brand and its services/products on social media, a good rule to stick to is the 80:20 rule. This rule states that of all the content you post on social media, only 20% should be promoting your services or products. The majority of your content or posts (80%) should be aimed at being social and engaging your audience with value. This value can be in the form of actionable information, tips, tricks, insights, or industry knowledge, or in the form of entertaining content, but perhaps the most valuable type of content when it comes to authentic engagement is UGC. Customers like to see other people like them engaging with your brand, and by amplifying real experiences through your social channels, you make your target audience feel more heard and appreciated. This will translate to even more interaction and engagement from your followers</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1218px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1218px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2a2a8bf15c37be076557_image3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Cosmetics brand <a href=\"https://www.morphe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Morphe</a> reshares community photos, crediting the user in the caption to build rapport and social proof within its online community.</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Irrelevant content</strong></li></ul><p>Brands that already know about the 80:20 rule, or about the importance of sharing non-promotional content often make the mistake of sharing irrelevant content.According to Goodfirms, irrelevant content is one of the top two reasons for users to stop following a brand. <a href=\"https://www.clickz.com/why-consumers-follow-and-unfollow-brands-on-social-media/262169/\" target=\"_blank\">45% of users unfollow</a> a brand because the brand shares too much irrelevant or promotional content. Note that “irrelevant content” doesn’t simply mean content that isn’t relevant to your niche. It can also mean that you are posting the ‘wrong’ kind of content for a specific social media platform. For instance, sharing personal anecdotes and stories may work well on Facebook but the strategy will almost certainly backfire on a professional network like LinkedIn.</p><p>‍<strong>Solution: </strong>That’s why it is important for social media marketers to continually check their content for relevance. This doesn’t just help you maintain your follower numbers, it also helps your brand build niche authority and credibility. Practice <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-free-hashtag-analytics-tools-that-every-brand-needs/\" target=\"_blank\">social listening</a> by identifying which posts are the most successful within your community, and what type of content gets your audience excited about interacting with your brand online.</p><ul> \t<li><strong>Only Posting Content On Profile</strong></li></ul><p>Another common mistake that brands make on social media is to simply post content through their own <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-instagram-username\" target=\"_blank\">handles</a>. They don’t join conversations or groups, which can potentially lead their audience to unfollow them.Unlike traditional forms of advertising, social media marketing success cannot be achieved by simply ‘shouting’ your content at your followers. </p><p>‍<strong>Solution: </strong>On social media, it is important to engage with your audience.</p><p>That can mean anything ranging from following back your most active followers, engaging on their posts and stories, and joining relevant conversations in social media groups.</p><p>Doing this will give your social media presence dual benefits. One, you will be able to boost your brand’s visibility by posting in comment sections and groups, improving your chances of attracting more relevant social media followers. Two, this will also enable you to build more niche authority and credibility for your business. And three, by engaging with posts in your community and even reposting content from your customers, your account will appear more authentic and welcoming.</p><p>Finally, engaging with your audience will also help you establish a human element to your brand, instead of having a faceless corporate perception. </p><ul> \t<li><strong>Posting too frequently</strong></li></ul><p>While inconsistency in posting content on social media is a well-known way to fail, posting too much can also potentially hurt your brand. Across all age groups on social media, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/712831/brand-actions-social-media-causing-unfollows-by-age/\" target=\"_blank\">the top reasons</a> for unfollowing a brand account stem from posts coming across as “annoying” and “spammy.</p><p>”If a user has to scroll through 10 posts on their feed simply to see a post by someone other than you, they will feel that your content is ‘clogging’ their feed and will be prompted to unfollow.</p><p>‍<strong>Solution: </strong>There is no right answer to how many posts are ‘ideal’. However, there has been a lot of research conducted on the matter and the ideal answer depends on the social media platform(s) that you are using and of course, on the preferences of your audience. With that said, the scores of studies and surveys conducted on this matter have revealed <a href=\"https://louisem.com/144557/often-post-social-media#:~:text=Most%20studies%20agree%20that%20once,Pages%203%20times%20per%20week.\" target=\"_blank\">some numbers</a> that you can use as a starting point and then modify your strategy based on the response you get from your audience.</p><p>The bottom line is, social media is a conversation channel, and should always be treated as such. If you’re rapidly losing followers, the chances are, your social media marketing strategy is not customer-centric.</p><p>Whenever you design a new campaign or are authoring your latest social media post, ask yourself if you are adding value to your audience’s lives. Being customer-centric doesn’t guarantee your chances of success on social media, but it greatly improves your chances.</p><p>‍<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-kakkar-494b0b3/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Vaibhav Kakkar</em></strong></a><em> is the founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"https://www.digitalwebsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Digital Web Solutions</em></a><em>, a globally trusted agency with a full suite of digital marketing services and development solutions.

They arrive at this feed by navigating to the “For You” page. Since these ads are integrated with the feed, it’s easy to grab users’ attention and drive engagement through comments and likes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This holds true especially for brands creating ads with an authentic feel or featuring <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC).

You’re asking mobile users to take the action of turning their phones to the side when you create a TikTok ad in the 16:9 aspect ratio.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Although that can be a hindrance to some users, creators sometimes use this aspect ratio because it is the more cinematic and spacey option. Elements in your video are magnified and it’s easier to create more dramatic effects.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">An important thing to remember is that when you create an ad in the 16:9 mode, the caption will be to the right of the video, and the like, share, and comment buttons to the top. So create your video in such a way that those elements don’t clash with the viewing experience using our safe zone template for 16:9 videos.. That said, TikTok is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63981657\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">experimenting with a native landscape viewing mode</a> and that may make it easier to deliver videos in the 16:9 aspect ratio.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1280px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1280px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63c200b8fad2a20252a181e3_image2.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"graphic on how to make a sideways TikTok\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls3MZjRyhvA\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Kapwing on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\">1:1 Aspect Ratio</h3><p id=\"\">The 1:1 aspect ratio produces content in a square shape. It is not recommended that you use this aspect ratio for video ads on TikTok as the 9:16 aspect ratio is a better option. But you might consider going 1:1 for images since they don’t contain moving elements as videos do. TikTok’s “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/tiktok-photo-mode\" id=\"\">photo mode</a>” allows users to create carousels of static photos that can be swiped through by viewers, and some of these videos use a 1:1 format.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">TikTok Ad Best Practices &amp; Tips</h2><p id=\"\">We now have a good idea of what the specifications are for different ad types on TikTok. Let’s now take a look at how you can create ads (and organic posts!) to maximize engagement on the platform and reach your desired audience.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Limit Video Length</h3><p id=\"\">We’ve seen that there are ad formats that allow you to create videos that are as long as sixty seconds. Organic TikToks can even be up to 10 minutes long. Although it’s nice to have that much room, it’s ideal that you keep your videos down to between nine and fifteen seconds in length, or you’ll risk losing your viewers’ attention.</p><p id=\"\">Some types of informative videos, particularly ones requested by brands or certain collaborations where influencers will promote a given product can be longer and still perform well. For example, this TikTok on <a href=\"https://hobowithalaptop.com/housesitting-jobs-guide\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">house sitting</a> is part of a branded hashtag challenge and gives detailed info on how to use the Trusted House Sitters app. The time limit on this is still capped at 50 seconds - just under a minute.<br></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1126px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1126px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63c200ce0db0883269b7d9b6_image7.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Screenshot from TikTok of housesitting Q\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The main reason for this is that TikTok as a platform shows a preference for short videos. It’s unlikely that your audience will want to sit through an ad that’s a minute long, so you need to try to get your message across in about a fourth of that time ideally. The whole point of short-form video is to present bite-sized information and entertainment for users.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Create Vertical Videos</h3><p id=\"\">It used to be that videos were created in landscape mode for screens that were oriented that way. But platforms like TikTok have changed that with their mobile-first approach to content.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">What that means for businesses is that you need to start creating vertical videos regularly for TikTok and other such platforms. This could mean shooting all your videos on a phone or editing landscape videos so that <a href=\"https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/3-ways-to-convert-landscape-video-to-portrait.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">they can be consumed in the vertical format</a>. Shooting videos on a smartphone isn’t a bad idea; most UGC is created on phones and customers tend to trust it more than traditional brand content.</p><h3 id=\"\">Make an Impact Early</h3><p id=\"\">This point is a corollary to the one about limited video length. You have only a couple of seconds to grab the attention of users on TikTok. If you don’t, they will scroll away from the video and not complete the call to action.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Now there are a couple of ways that you can go about making a quick impact on a viewer. The first is by writing copy that quickly shows the viewer that they’re watching something that is highly relevant to them. The other option is to create imagery that grabs their attention and forces them to keep watching. You can also include soundtracks from TikTok’s <a href=\"https://www.videvo.net/royalty-free-music/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">libraries of royalty-free music</a> which can keep viewers listening for slightly longer periods of time.</p><h3 id=\"\">Position Key Elements Centrally</h3><p id=\"\">The TikTok screen is one that is crowded with a lot of different elements. Even if you’re just scrolling through your feed, you’re going to see the name of the account, the like and share buttons, the video caption, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">To avoid having your content obscured by all those elements, make sure that all your main content is positioned centrally in the video. This will ensure that viewers see everything you want them to see and are more likely to engage with the given call to action.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">A good example of this is <a href=\"https://www.sleepjunkie.com/best-mail-order-mattress/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">mail-order mattress company Sleepjunkie’s</a> TikTok affiliate marketing campaign. The most important elements such as the deadline and reward are centrally positioned on the screen, making the most out of the 9:16 aspect ratio.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1918px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1918px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63c200e64de9ea31f50e03ab_image6.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Screenshot of TikTok post with \"></div></figure><p id=\"\">So there you have it! Whether your brand is looking to break into the short-form video space or simply uplevel its organic TikTok strategy, having these ad specs in the back of your mind is always helpful. Once you begin to create videos for your brand or share UGC from your community on TikTok, consider repurposing that content for other platforms like <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/instagram-reels\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Instagram Reels</a>. And remember to center your video elements!</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">As a marketer on TikTok, it’s easy to fall into the “swipe by and forget” trap that faces many brands today. This is because users have been conditioned to distinguish carefully curated, polished brand content from the authentic user videos that ultimately drive TikTok’s popularity.</p><p id=\"\">This is where <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/7-influencer-video-campaigns-you-need-to-try-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer videos</a>, <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC), and TikTok UGC Creators (a blend of the two) may be helpful as a learning tool for your brand. Check out what types of influencer and user content are popular with your target audience, and apply those techniques to the content your brand shares on TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You can push past an expensive yet generic TikTok marketing approach and grow your audience while cultivating trust and loyalty with these TikTok UGC Creator secrets. But first, a bit of background.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Low Down on TikTok UGC Creators</h2><p id=\"\">UGC refers to any kind of media that is created by everyday users rather than a brand, design agency, or other organization, and often posted on social media. Though UGC often endorses brands or products, these posts are unpaid and unsponsored. The content is organic. Even though the users have no affiliation with your brand, they disseminate positive information about your product. UGC is word-of-mouth marketing, at scale. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1632px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1632px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637418abc95be04eafd6feee_morphe%20tiktok%20ugc%20influencers.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshots of influencer TikTok videos showing Morphe makeup products\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">On the other side of the spectrum, influencers with sizable audiences promote brand products in exchange for payment. Here influencers declare that they are being paid, and the content is usually more polished and professional. They’ve built an online community that trusts their recommendations and testimonials, but bigger influencers may be too expensive or busy for your brand to work with.</p><p id=\"\">Enter the UGC Creator: a UGC creator makes content that seems organic and authentic, but usually has financial incentives attached to their content. They specialize in producing content for brands that looks and feels authentic and believable. </p><p id=\"\">You are paying them for exactly this content, and they typically don’t share it on their own profiles. ‘UGC-inspired content’, if you will. It’s about finding that balance between creating good quality content without polished perfection and professional curation that turns people off and makes the content seem inauthentic. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637418ff39de10e84eaf1a0c_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-15%20at%202.55.16%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Two screenshots of TikTok videos from UGC Creators holding boc\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">On TikTok especially, UGC Creators build videos that incorporate the elements of everyday content on the app, making products and brands look trendy and exciting while attainable. They often utilize popular audio clips, fonts and filters, and overall editing styles that match the other videos a user would see in his or her For You page.</p><p id=\"\">While UGC Creators can be valuable assets to brands looking to uplevel their social game, not all brands have the budget, resources, or time to work with an outside creator. However, marketers <em id=\"\">can</em> emanate their style of videos, and reap some of the benefits associated with UGC.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why User-Generated Content (UGC) Supports Brand Content</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cost Effective With High ROI</strong></h3><p id=\"\">UGC is incredibly cost-effective, while providing additional the benefits of trust and authenticity that traditional marketing can never generate on its own. The money you’d pay a UGC Creator is often much less than your brand would spend on a content creation team (writers, camera operators, actors, etc.) or a campaign with a popular influencer.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">More Personal &amp; Specific To A Particular Demographic</strong></h3><p id=\"\">UGC in general creates visibility, and is specifically relatable to that demographic. This is invaluable as it connects deeply with the audience. Traditional marketing cannot scale content for specific audiences; it is time consuming, resource intensive, and very expensive. The ROI would be too low to justify the cost.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Building Trust</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Trust is very hard to create as a brand selling a product. Content creators that operate on a smaller scale have audiences that are very invested in them as a person. They feel close to them. UGC at this level gives you access to a community of people that have a high level of trust in the creator. And when a UGC creator talks about a product, your target audience is more likely to relate to and trust them. Seeing people just like them use a product influences your audience’s purchasing decisions. As a brand, you have access to an invaluable next-level authenticity and a community that is very hard to create from scratch.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Stronger Engagement and SEO</strong></h3><p id=\"\">UGC has much stronger engagement rates than traditional ads, often because it feels more authentic, and relatable to viewers. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-to-get-more-views-on-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">TikTok’s algorithm</a> favors posts with stronger engagement, so working with a UGC Creator or sharing UGC from your community can increase your chances of going viral.</p><p id=\"\">Traditional marketing techniques today often feel too much like advertising. We scroll through TikTok for entertainment, not necessarily to be shown a product every few videos. There is nothing worse than interrupting fun with a flashing ‘PLEASE BUY THIS’, obvious ad.</p><h2 id=\"\">9 UGC Creator Secrets for Marketers</h2><p id=\"\">TikTok is a social media whirlwind that has swept up <a href=\"https://www.digitalinformationworld.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">more than a billion users</a> in less than a decade. That is ONE BILLION potential customers that you can connect with. UGC is a brilliant way to leverage an audience and direct them towards your product.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Here are some of the ways UGC works, how you can apply this to your overall content strategy, and what your brand stands to learn and gain from TikTok UGC Creators making engaging content for the app.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Credibility, Authenticity, &amp; Relatability: Know Your Audience</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The angle you’re going for with UGC is authenticity. When you’re getting your creator to build content for your profile, or if you’re building content yourself, it’s crucial to be familiar with your audience’s likes and dislikes. A TikTok user can sniff a sell-out from a mile away, and trust once broken is hard to fix. So don’t ruin the vibe by being too in-your-face with the advertising- keep it natural. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63741989dcae2f58c99e8e2f_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-15%20at%202.57.55%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of TikTok video with woman showing how to set up iPhone on top of computer to create a webcam\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Relatable, natural content can be made with your iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">TikTok content should remain fun and relatable, it should have the same vibe as everything else that attracted the audience to the account in the first place, but with a tiny sprinkling of product placement to go with it. It shouldn't lose its credibility. Frame the product as valuable and attainable for your specific audience.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. Know Your Style: Stay on Brand</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Collaborate with creators that have the same values as you, and are familiar with the types of customers in your industry. For example, an athletic apparel brand will likely want to partner with UGC Creators that are active in their everyday lives.</p><p id=\"\">UGC creates interest. The audience you’re talking to should be interested in your product, and the product should provide them with value, solve a problem for them. Picking a creator for the type of audience they are familiar with is far better than picking them for their audience size.Engagement and interest are your currencies and providing something of value will cultivate customer loyalty. Play the long game, and create customers for life.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. FOMO and Aspiration: You’re Missing Out!</strong></h3><p id=\"\">When a TikTok video conveys the benefits of a product with excitement, the audience feels like they're missing out on a good thing. They’re being sold a dream. Your brand and product should feel like something they’re missing out on, a solution to their problems, a fulfillment of their desires. Customer and UGC Creator content are both solid ways to showcase your products in that desirable but attainable light.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/637419d7c789e98c3fbd8ff2_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-15%20at%202.59.12%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshots of TikTok influencer promoting Kiala Greens protein powder\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">This TikTok creator showcases a nutrition brand’s benefits, showing and telling viewers what they’re missing out on without the product.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Unique </strong><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/followme-how-to-track-your-brand-hashtag\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Branded Hashtags</strong></a><strong id=\"\">: A Memorable Signature</strong></h3><p id=\"\">This is a fun and interesting way to encourage your customers to create organic UGC. Create a campaign around a unique hashtag, preferably a few words long, Camel case to make it better understandable, catchy, and easy to remember. These work as categorization tags too and help you collect data on your audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Hashtag challenges are fun ways to get a whole group of people interested in your product. Everyone has a fun new creative outlet to express themselves and build a community with.</p><p id=\"\">Coca-Cola’s #ShareACoke hashtag got millions of creators making fun wholesome content of sharing a coke with friends. This creates a shared reality, the content is engaging and evokes powerful emotion.&nbsp; During the Pandemic, Peleton created their #TogetherWeGoFar with the premise of creating connectivity in a time where everyone felt disconnected. Redbull has a fantastic #GivesYouWings hashtag provoking insanely intense, adventurous content.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Marketing Through Gamification: Creating Fun Incentives</strong></h3><p id=\"\">As a brand, using fun challenges to increase visibility and engagement on TikTok is a cool way of generating organic UGC. Create a trend, define what to do, and create hype enough that everyone wants to try it out. You could create a brand specific filter that everyone can use, or define a dance challenge, or a set of actions to complete.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Offering up incentives to entice more users into participating and using your products is another tactic that creates excitement and works. Just like with a brand hashtag, you can automatically collect the content created by your community that’s related to your brand with a UGC platform like Pixlee TurnTo. This is a valuable asset to marketers who want to maximize the value of their community-driven content, reusing it across social media and other channels that could benefit from social proof.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1226px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1226px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63616cb45ec57f52d4868ddb_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-01%20at%2011.57.55%20AM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">HYLETE urges its TikTok followers to participate in trends and challenges, resharing customer content on their own account and on the brand’s website.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">6. Quality and Consistency: Post at the Right Times</strong></h3><p id=\"\">While quality should be your priority when designing a TikTok marketing strategy, your videos may get a bit more attention if they’re posted at the optimal time for your audience. Check out our full guide to learn the <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/the-best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">best time to post on TikTok</a> for your unique followers.</p><p id=\"\">It may seem daunting to create a consistent stream of content for TikTok, which is why reusing customer UGC often lightens the creative load on social media marketers. For the content you do end up having to create yourself, check out tips from UGC Creators on TikTok just by searching for them. Some of their editing tricks like transitions and lighting can help you create a fast, easily-repeatable process for filming videos.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1534px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1534px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63741a9649a97c708bd2875b_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-15%20at%203.02.04%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Screenshot of UGC creator setting up two bottles of lotion in front of a background.\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">7. Personal Interaction: Engage With Your Audience</strong></h3><p id=\"\">I love it when I get a cheeky reply from a brand on a comment I posted. It is so gratifying to be acknowledged by the brand on a UGC post you created. It creates good rapport and it generates a personal bond with your audience. Feeling that personal connection and building a relationship with your customers is integral for brand loyalty. Treating them well, and giving them attention will keep them coming back. People love to feel seen, and even better- appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Just like creators do, your brand has the opportunity to interact with its TikTok community. Doing so, especially when it comes to engaging with their own original content, promotes UGC creation while building trust in your brand. Resharing their content can also incentivize them to post more positive testimonials about your brand or product.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">8. Behind The Scenes: Employee Content</strong></h3><p id=\"\">What do your brand employees have to do with UGC Creators? Well, TikTok UGC Creators often gain followers on their own accounts for showing users an inside look at how they create authentic videos for brands. You can apply this knowledge to your brand’s own TikTok videos by showcasing your employees in videos, giving users an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the real people behind your products.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1392px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1392px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63741af149a97c0128d29883_employee%20content%20tiktok.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Like UGC Creators, your brand can make your audience feel like an insider. Give them a secret sneak-peek inside look at all the fun and work that goes into running your brand. Your employees are also users generating content.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">9. The Right Balance: Quality, Creativity, Legality</strong></h3><p id=\"\">TikTok rewards creativity and originality. People love to see experiences they can relate to showcased in a creative way; that’s why UGC Creators are booming on the app. Check out some of these ways a product can be showcased on the app beyond just telling your audience why it’s beneficial:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2188px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2188px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63741b3549a97c4b23d2999e_Screen%20Shot%202022-11-15%20at%203.04.51%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Always check for copyright infringements. As a brand, you cannot repost content without permission from the original creators. Brand safety is important to the way you source and share content on TikTok, another reason a UGC platform may be a good choice for you. </p><p id=\"\">With Pixlee TurnTo, brands can automatically request permission from users on TikTok, Instagram, and more channels without leaving the UGC platform. They can also invite content creators to become a part of the brand’s opt-in, proprietary network of creators in Pixlee TurnTo.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"\">Towards UGC and Beyond</h1><p id=\"\">Highlighting users that generate fun content is a fantastic way of growing your brand’s community and social traffic, as is working with UGC Creators. A mutually beneficial relationship where creative content gets more traffic and reaches a larger audience with your brand’s reposting, and brands in turn get genuine customer testimonials and promotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">TikTok is such a powerful marketing tool you can leverage to grow your audience. Tap into some of the ways everyday users and content creators utilize TikTok to build content that stands out without looking like an advertisement. After all, brand-built content and UGC go hand-in-hand.</p>",

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Welcome to the wild, wacky world of TikTok, the app that has become a cultural phenomenon, a bottomless pit of entertainment, and the core of many brands’ social media marketing efforts. Combining catchy tunes and audio clips with user creativity, it’s fun, quick, entertaining, and infinite. This app is the perfect cocktail made for the people of this generation, boasting a carefully curated algorithm targeting the Millennial and Gen Z brains.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">While Millennials and Gen Z are often grouped together as the ‘younger’ internet generation, they have had very different life experiences. It seems TikTok permeates across all age groups, but there is a generation gap there that visibly reflects in the behavior of each demographic on the app, and the content surfaced to them.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1072px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1072px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407ca52dfb73d33d09bc2ee_image4%20(12).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.oberlo.in/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">What are the differences in TikTok user behavior between the two demographics? What are the differences in their content preferences? How does each group respond to different types of content? What are the trends seen in content consumption and <a href=\"https://contentatscale.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">content creation</a>?&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">And most importantly, <strong id=\"\">what does this mean for your TikTok marketing strategy?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">TikTok users spent around <a href=\"https://www.demandsage.com/tiktok-user-statistics/#:~:text=TikTok%20Statistics%202023%20(Top%20Picks,those%20are%20monthly%20active%20users.\" target=\"_blank\">$2.3 billion in 2021</a>. There is so much opportunity just waiting to be tapped. If you play your cards right, TikTok could be a major driver of growth for your business, both in terms of sales and community engagement.</p><h1 id=\"\">Millennials vs. Gen Z&nbsp;</h1><p id=\"\">Millennials are the OG Internet Kids. They were born between the early 80s and mid-90s, so they’re currently all grown up and in their late 20s to early 40s. They’re the ones who remember dial-up internet days and AOL instant messenger but have also adapted to the digital age.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Gen Z, aka the Zoomers, are the cool kids on the block. Born between the mid-90s and early 2010, they’re young, they’re fun, and are currently between 9 and 26 years old. They're the first generation that grew up with smartphones attached to their hands and social media flowing through their veins. Gen Zers tend to be digitally connected, fluid and exploratory, politically aware, and not afraid to challenge traditional institutions.</p><h1 id=\"\">Understanding Millennial and Gen Z behavior on TikTok and What It Means TikTok Marketing</h1><p id=\"\">If you’re targeting everybody, you’re targeting nobody. Knowing your audience and understanding their behavior is your golden ticket to effective marketing.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:941px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"941px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407ca6509214655919e1f1f_image2%20(17).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/tiktok-a-key-part-of-consumers-path-to-purchase/437912/#close\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">While it’s easy to throw them into the same basket with the “internet generation” tag and make your marketing easier and less cumbersome, your brand risks losing out on the nuances that get you the results you really crave. You have got to understand the way they think.</p><p id=\"\">While the app is the same for all users, regardless of demographic, differences arise in their behavior on the app, and everyone has a different experience. Take a look at the individuals followed by Millennials vs. Gen Z in this graph:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1063px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1063px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407caa8aceb32829e75b0b3_image7%20(7).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://fanbytes.co.uk/gen-z-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Let’s compare Millennial and Gen Z user behavior on TikTok and understand them better.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">DISCLAIMER</strong>: Take the statistical inferences with a grain of salt; these are patterns of preferences observed <strong id=\"\">on average </strong>in a demographic<strong id=\"\"> </strong>and may not represent the entire population.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">One-Sided Entertainment vs. Interactive Content</strong></h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1053px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1053px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407ca734b4b4765de9bd796_image3%20(15).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/tiktok-demographics\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Millennials tend to consume content, while Gen Zers are often the creators of that content. This may be the most fundamental difference in the lens through which the two demographics view TikTok. For Millennials, Tiktok is a source of entertainment. They open the app and entertain themselves by scrolling. It is more one-sided and consumption-centric. More “media” than “social,” if you will.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Gen Z, on the other hand, uses TikTok as more than just an entertainment consumption platform; they use it to communicate. It is a medium for video-based dialogue, it’s used to express opinions and build communities of like-minded individuals.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For Gen Z more so than Millennials, TikTok enhances socializing by creating opportunities for group activities like dance challenges and trends. It is almost like an extension of themselves, a virtual personality, a platform for self-expression, and a creative outlet. It checks all the boxes as a multi-utility platform for Gen Z.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:880px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"880px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407cabb927082dd4aaf3169_image5%20(14).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/insights\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing Implications:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Capturing the Gen Z market is much easier when you tap into the more social aspects of the app. As a brand, <strong id=\"\">creating trends and challenges </strong>that allow for interactive activities is a good way to reach this audience. You can even create a filter and unique hashtag for your brand and incentivize people to use it. It’s fun when everyone gets in on a trend and when friends can meet up and learn a dance for TikTok.</p><p id=\"\">As we continue to discuss the trends between these two generations, remember that TikTok is a valuable source of <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\">user-generated content</a> (UGC). This is especially if your brand utilizes a UGC platform like Pixlee TurnTo that allows you to collect, permission, and reshare TikTok content from fans across your marketing channels.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Nostalgic &amp; Aspirational vs. Relatable &amp; Trendy</strong></h2><p id=\"\">While both generations tend to trust and consume authentic content from real people like them (UGC), the style of that content differs slightly between the two groups. While Millennials prefer content that is idealistic and aspirational, Gen Z’ers connect more with raw, unfiltered content. Millennials also enjoy throwback content, they’re old enough to relate to ‘the good old days’ now. Nostalgia is a powerful thing.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Gen Z grew up with social media, people communicating with other people, not brands. They love content that gives you a peek into others' lives. They have grown up with access to the internet, been exposed to a vast array of information, and have developed a more critical eye toward traditional media and large corporations. Raw and authentic is what speaks to them.</p><p id=\"\">It’s important to note that the power of authentic content in marketing is continuing to rise, and brands should not just stick to traditional advertising methods when targeting Millennials. Test out different content types on TikTok to see what resonates best with your audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, both generations tend to respond well to influencer marketing content on TikTok. TikTok influencers with 15K followers or less have a <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">17.96% engagement rate</a>, beating Instagram's 3.86% average.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1040px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1040px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407ca349270822ea7aed03f_image1%20(17).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/Gen-Z-TikTok/pc/en\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"><em>Marketing</em> Implications:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">UGC and influencer marketing are powerful assets for your brand’s TikTok strategy, but it’s important to curate the content you share depending on which generation you are targeting with each post.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Gen Zers Have Shorter Attention Spans Than Millennials</strong></h2><p id=\"\">On average, millennials have an attention span that is <a href=\"https://www.thehealthyjournal.com/faq/why-is-gen-z-attention-span-so-short\" target=\"_blank\">50% longer</a> than Gen Z kids. In general, everyone is so hyperstimulated that even the slightest dull moment in a video will cause them to scroll past. Gen Z has an incredibly low attention span of just 8 seconds.</p><p id=\"\">While Millennials may have the capacity for longer-form content, Gen Z loves a short-form banger video. A perfectly stimulating amalgamation of good visuals, catchy music, and fun personalities.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing Implications:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">After analyzing the insights from almost any <a href=\"https://keyhole.co/blog/social-media-report/\" target=\"_blank\">social media report</a>, the bottom line is simple. In the case of Gen Z, this simply translates into short-form video content, easily created with a <a href=\"https://www.movavi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">video editor</a> and a good imagination. It’s a good general rule to keep TikTok videos 15 seconds or shorter.</p><p id=\"\">It involves creating the perfect cocktail of background audio, sound effects, enticing visuals, right-length video cuts, <a href=\"https://flixier.com/tools/video-editor-transitions\" target=\"_blank\">transitions</a>, and scripting. You need to maximize the attention-grabbing element while minimizing the chances of them scrolling past.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cautious, Focused, and Responsible vs. Open-to-Risk, Impulsive, and Trendy</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Millennials (whether they like it or not) are growing up. They’re starting families and settling into careers. They (sort of) know who they are and they know what they want. So a lot of the content that appeals to them tends to lean in the more stable and responsible direction. They love tutorial and DIY-type content, lifestyle hacks, products that optimize for efficiency at home and professionally, and products that will enhance their lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Gen Z individuals, on the other hand, are young, may have fewer commitments, and have a lot more freedom. They are much less risk-averse and aren’t afraid of trying new things. They’re on their journey of self-discovery and are willing to explore new trends, styles, products, and brands. You will find that they hop on to the latest trends immediately, they don’t mind trying new fashion styles, and they love finding new ways to express and explore themselves.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">67% of Gen Z respondents say that TikTok content <a href=\"https://www.hellosocial.com.au/blog/how-to-advertise-on-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">influences their purchasing decisions</a>, compared to 56% of millennial respondents.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing Implications:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">You can count on Gen Z’s impulsiveness and openness to new ideas to buy into new products and services. They want what’s new, they want to be trendsetters, and they want to be on top of the latest obsessions that take over the internet. The ‘early adopter’ tag brings with it a lot of social capital. This means if you can generate hype and convince them something is cool, you’ve got them in the palm of your hand.</p><p id=\"\">Millennials are more cautious about spending (as they should be). They are making their own money and have bills to pay, so they are much less impulsive with their buys, often reading product reviews before making purchases.</p><p id=\"\">Marketing products and services with a high focus on their utility are what gets them interested. They buy what is useful and efficient, and they trust brands with an established online community that vouches for their products. This is another reason why UGC can be so valuable to your TikTok marketing campaigns.<br></p><p id=\"\">It’s also a point worth noting that Millennials have more money to spend, but only on things that are worth it. So if you can convince them that a product will be of good use to them, and worth it, you can price your products higher since they have the means to spend decent money.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Gen Z Values Fun, Positivity, Inclusivity, And Acceptance</strong></h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:915px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"915px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/6407cb09844f3739a46785bd_image6%20(10).webp\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/insights\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Gen Z is incredibly socially aware and holds value-driven brands in high esteem. Socially-conscious brands find massive success in the current market. They expect brands to be transparent, politically correct, and supportive of social justice causes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Gen Z strongly values diversity, equity, and inclusion, and this translates to the brands they support. They are very aware and vocal about the climate crisis, and value prioritizing their mental health.</p><p id=\"\">While Millennials don’t necessarily oppose any of this, they just aren’t as active on the scene as Gen Z. It’s hard to stay on top of these issues as they are so dynamic and fluid. Millennials tend to value stability, work-life balance, and personal and professional development more, and that is where their energies are focused.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing Implications:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The Gen Z demographic tends to support brands that align with their values and promote causes that they care about. Branding your products as “environmentally friendly” “cruelty-free,” “vegan,” can help connect with your audience, as can showcasing those values through your TikTok content.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Having a diverse <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/5-types-of-brand-influencers-which-one-is-right-for-you\" target=\"_blank\">group of influencers</a> promoting your content, and showing your support for all means of self-expression is helpful as well- this will help connect with the audience and grow brand trust and loyalty.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"\">Looking Ahead</h1><p id=\"\">If you're looking to make it big with social media marketing, it's important to understand that different generations have different preferences.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With the Gen Z crowd, it's all about entertainment, human connection, and exciting new trends. Brands need to get creative and champion authenticity to win their hearts (and their credit cards).</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, Millennials are all about information. For them, it's crucial to have a clear and concise message that's still relatable and relevant. Brands need to get to the point, but not lose their touch of personality.</p><p id=\"\">Think of it like a recipe for success; these are just general trends to build upon. Every target audience is unique, as is every product, and the best approach is to mix and match your social media strategies to see what works best for your particular audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Understand your audience and listen to your data. Be clear and concise in your marketing messages while still being relatable and relevant to your target audience. Remember to have a little fun with it! You’d be surprised what a long way that goes.&nbsp;</p>",

A powerhouse for engagement, TikTok has become the go-to social media channel for users to share short-form videos, but brands have been slower to enter the playing field.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With only <a href=\"https://www.socialpilot.co/tiktok-marketing/tiktok-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">3.7%</a> of all TikTok content shared by brand accounts, it’s a great time to start generating TikTok video ideas and build an audience on the app before it becomes saturated with advertisements. Let’s dive into some community-driven video ideas ecommerce brands in any industry can take advantage of to boost brand awareness and drive sales.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Product Review Videos</h2><p id=\"\">Around <a href=\"https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/tiktok-made-me-buy-it\" id=\"\">49% of users</a> have said that TikTok influenced them to make a purchase. While your first instinct as a social media marketer may be to run ads on the platform, testimonials from real customers can serve as valuable content to kick off organic TikTok engagement. The app is famous for <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">influencer marketin</a>g and <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC) shared by people every day, and your brand stands to benefit from resharing this type of content.</p><p id=\"\">Around <a href=\"https://trustmary.com/video-testimonials/video-testimonial-statistics-that-you-should-mind/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">79% of people</a> have watched a video testimonial to learn more about a company’s product. People feel they can trust a review from a customer more because the reviewer has no obligation to say positive things about the company. They can also relate to and identify with other customers like themselves, and even influencers on TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Instead of just creating your own TikTok videos for your brand’s profile, it’s worth your time to reach out to micro-influencers and scope out UGC already out there from your customers. Both options pave the way for honest, persuasive product review videos you can reshare on TikTok and/or other marketing channels like your website.</p><p id=\"\">Check out the screenshot below. It shows a product review of a showerhead by Blatantreviews, a popular account with 3.6 million followers TikTok. The high level of engagement through likes, comments, shares and saves is proof of how much people appreciate honest reviews from third-party sources.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1480px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4baea114f456fb7d6bb1_image11.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@blatantreviews/video/7059137505551060271?_t=8VTy7OXloG5&_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Pixlee TurnTo’s platform allows brands to manage and publish content from customers on TikTok (and other social channels) at scale. No more searching manually for brand mentions or relying on your TikTok notifications; a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/social-ugc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social UGC</a> platform helps you find and reuse the highest-quality content from your community. Brands can also search for influencers based on a variety of filters and launch partnerships within the Pixlee TurnTo platform.</p><p id=\"\">When leveraging product review videos, you can ask your reviewers to utilize the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/tiktok-made-me-buy-it-use-tiktok-for-ecommerce-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">#TikTokMadeMeBuyIt</a>. It’s a hashtag TikTok users include in their posts where they share or show off a product.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The thing about this hashtag is that it has given even small businesses a lot of promotion. According to TikTok, the hashtag has had 6.4 billion views and counting. That can be a lot of eyeballs for your brand!</p><p id=\"\">Ask your users to add popular music to their product reviews, too. If they can, they should use the sounds that popular videos under the hashtag are using. According to TikTok, this is one way TikTok users can find your video on the platform and know more about your business.&nbsp;You can also consider a <a href=\"https://www.movavi.com/learning-portal/best-video-editor-for-tiktok.html\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok video editor</a> to make these posts even more polished.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Get to Know Employees</h2><p id=\"\">Alongside featuring more UGC in their social media posts, marketers today are also humanizing their brands by showing the faces behind the operation. No matter what industry your brand falls into, resharing your team’s own content or featuring them in a string of TikTok videos can further help users connect with your brand and feel more willing to purchase your product.</p><p id=\"\">Be sure to sprinkle some value into the posts you create with your employees, whether that means answering questions about how your product works, educating viewers about how your brand has grown over the years, or simply entertaining them with a funny anecdote.</p><p id=\"\">Delta is a prime example of a brand with diverse TikTok video content and a heavy focus on employees (like flight attendants, pilots, and airport employees). As the brand maintains a lighthearted voice and style on TikTok, many of these employee-led videos are humorous and utilize trending songs and filters on the app.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1480px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4bca873fffd630774cb7_image12.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Here are some more ideas to get your employees involved in your TikTok videos:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Showcase how they use your product in day-to-day life</li><li id=\"\">Behind-the-scenes tour of your headquarters</li><li id=\"\">Telling their story and why they work for your brand</li><li id=\"\">Answering common questions from customers</li><li id=\"\">Sharing unique ways to use your product or service</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">3. How-To Videos&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">Although TikTok is mostly known for lip-syncing videos, dance videos and challenges, educational videos, how-to videos have also become popular on the platform. The best thing about tutorial-style videos is that your social can create them in-house, solicit them from influencer partnerships, or encourage customers to create how-to UGC.</p><p id=\"\">Whether you’re just <a href=\"https://www.chamberofcommerce.com/advice/13-steps-to-successfully-starting-a-business\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">starting a business</a> or are already an established company, how-to videos can benefit brands in almost any industry. Since your marketing goal is to promote your product and ultimately drive conversion, then the best video topic should still be related to what you’re selling.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For instance, if you’re selling jeans, you could create an inspiration-style how-to video on how to pair the jeans with other clothing. Another option would be to create a how-to video on a service you’re offering. So, you’re essentially giving your audience a taste of what is to come if they avail of your service.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Check out this example from The Art Room, which sells art courses. On their TikTok profile, you see videos on how to draw different elements:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1272px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1272px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4bdcc73d730b2fdee340_image10.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@the.art.room/video/7165139522760510725?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Embroidery brand DMC frequently shares tutorials and craft inspiration from the brand’s team, influencers in the knitting world, and community members. To get the most value out of these videos, DMC also uses Pixlee TurnTo to display them in a shoppable “Shop TikTok” gallery on the brand’s website.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4bf3a114f4a3377d6c6b_image3.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Search around the TikTok app to identify common questions or topics in your industry that are attracting the most traffic. To do this, type in your industry in the search bar and examine the content from the “Top” and “Hashtags” sections as shown below. This is a good way to find trending how-to videos and model your own content after popular ones. So, if the video has copy interspersed across the video and uses music, just add copy and music to your how-to video, too. The rationale behind this is simple: these little things could be some of the reasons the video is doing so well on TikTok.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Stitches, Duets, and Comment Reply Videos</h2><p id=\"\">There are a variety of ways to engage with your audience on TikTok besides responding to comments. <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/tiktok-marketing-trends-2022\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stitches and duets</a> are two popular tools often used by influencers to interact with content from their communities and put their own spin on trending topics. While a stitch allows you to reshare a video and append your own content on the end of it, a duet plays the video in question alongside your post at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Stitches and duets are both great ways to show your TikTok audience that your brand actually cares about the opinions of customers and is present in an online space they’re commonly active in. For example, a TikTok user could share an unboxing video or a video about their favorite product from your brand, and you could stitch or duet that video, teasing new product releases or showing the product in different colors/styles.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1480px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4c01a1252701c249aed2_image13.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Similarly, comment reply videos refer to videos created by a user directly in response to a comment on a prior video posted by that same user. Comment reply videos appear in the comments section of the original video, and the comment that’s displayed in the new video redirects users back to the original post for context. Basically, you’re giving users more ways to discover your content and connect your videos to each other while interacting with comments from your fans.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Comparison Videos&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">Comparison videos should be on your list of great TikTok video content ideas, too. You can use comparison videos to highlight why your product is the best on the market. In the beginning, you may want to create a few of your brand’s own comparison videos and encourage your followers to follow suit.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Below is an example of a comparison video of two moisturizers made by a TikTok user:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1480px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4c325f53f96102599e41_Screen%20Shot%202022-12-30%20at%2012.31.46%20PM.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@chareesbeauty/video/7125832001214516486?_t=8VTxpHZUxyn&_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">You could come up with a slogan or branded hashtag, for instance, and let the users come up with the TikTok content. Using a branded hashtag also makes it easier for your team to locate and reshare videos your customers may be posting. TikTok is a hub for creativity, so users are bound to add their own spin on their comparison videos. This makes your content more diverse and authentic.</p><p id=\"\">For instance, when Pizza Hut came up with the slogan “No one outpizzas the Hut” to highlight how it’s supposedly better than its competitors such as Domino’s, many TikTok users came up with funny videos that didn’t talk about benefits and features. In the videos, some users just immediately concluded Pizza Hut was the better option, and they did so in a humorous way. Check out the example below:&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1212px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1212px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63af4c596205071b4055339e_image4%20(8).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pizzahut/video/7062907606301510958?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Repost the videos your followers share on your TikTok account (with permission) like Pizza Hut did in our example above. You can even use these videos on your website for social proof to level up your <a href=\"https://writer.com/guides/content-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">content strategy</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Unboxing Videos</h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/an-ecommerce-brands-guide-to-unboxing-videos\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Unboxing videos</a> make for great TikTok video content, too.

Then send them your products so they can create the unboxing video content. Just make sure the audience of the influencers you choose consists of the people you’re looking to reach, too.</p><p id=\"\">Note, too, that some TikTok users create unboxing videos without being sent a free package from the business. You can scour TikTok for these videos using tools such as Pixlee TurnTo and repost them on your TikTok or other marketing platforms.</p><p id=\"\">The unboxing videos don’t necessarily need to include a verbal review.

Naturally, who doesn’t want to eat Spaghetti alle Vongole in its native home of Naples, Italy? Marketers within these industries are always looking for ways to authentically scale their content to relate to consumers. Fortunately, with social media and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/solutions/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing</a>, marketers are finally getting the answers they’ve been looking for. Learn how these up-and-coming travel and food influencers built niche communities of followers who are passionate about experiences and see what marketers stand to learn from their success. </p><h3><em>Jen Morilla</em></h3><p>With a mission, “to create incredible possibilities of transformation for humankind to live lives of impact, purpose, and badassery,” Jen Morilla is always on the go. Visiting the most beautiful places on the planet, such as Costa Rica and Scotland, Jen strives to make a social impact and learn about the many nuances of cultures throughout the world. As well as backpacking for a living, she has a <a href=\"http://www.thesocialgirltraveler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> where she gives meaningful insight to her community of followers regarding essential packing lists for travel and how-to-travel guides to the best tourist locations. Jen explains that her audience is a mirror of herself, and brands that she works with need to reflect that as well.</p><p>“I work with socially, sustainable and eco-conscious brands.

Luisa spends her time traveling the world where she enjoys delicious meals at unique trendy restaurants and shares her findings with her 51 thousand Instagram followers. Luisa has explored different food options from London to Bali and is constantly on the move to discover more hidden gems. Luisa’s offers some sage advice to brands seeking to work with influencers: “...find someone who really resonates with the brand image you are trying to get across to your audience and know their worth. In my opinion, a brand would be better off paying a little more to an influencer who has a cult-like following than someone who has a large follower count but low engagement rates.” Whether it be a gourmet chicken recipe or the best chili fries around, Ruocco is determined to seek out the tastiest dishes in the world and share them with her community while working with brands who share her values.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:940px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"940px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e28febf819c27fea75e6e_newluisa.png\" alt=\"newluisa\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><em>Kimia Kalbasi</em></h3><p>Kimia Kalbasi has built a personal brand for herself revolving around tasty food and cool restaurant spots. From exquisite sushi rolls to indulgent slices of pizza, Kimia is determined to find the best places to eat for her community of food lovers. Not only does Kimia showcase delicious foods, but she <a href=\"https://kimiaskravings.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blogs</a> about her favorite healthy recipes and shares with her readers how they too can indulge in guilt-free goodies. Becoming an influencer isn’t easy, as Kimia shares her community-building journey:“The time and dedication are the most challenging as you're juggling countless other projects, campaigns, meetings, etc. Communities are not based on the ‘build it and they will come mentality.’ Communities need to be nurtured and cultivated in order to grow healthily but always have to remember the rewarding fulfillment it brings.</p><p>”Specializing as a San Franciscan food enthusiast, Kimia loves to work with hip young brands, such as David’s Tea and Sejoyia Coconut Bites. So, if you’re a Bay Area brand with a food-driven mission, Kimia may be the perfect match to seek out your target customer.

Luckily for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emilyshell/\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Fanning</a>, her community of Instagram followers has made this dream her reality. Emily fangirls over cutesy feminine brands, such as Pink Blush and Madewell that resonate with her community of “brunchers”. Emily showcases a brand's products in some of the best tourist locations, like Cape Cod or Santa Cruz. Emily advises a cautious approach to brands looking to work with influencers. “Numbers are not the end-all-be-all. Fortunately, many brands have caught on and are starting to pay attention to engagement as well as follower count, but they should still be careful - it's far too easy to <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/3-ways-to-check-if-your-brand-influencer-has-fake-followers/\" target=\"_blank\">buy likes</a>, which will feed into vanity metrics.</p><p>”With authenticity as the backbone of her following, Emily is working on <em>organically </em>growing her number of 7.5K Instagram followers. If aesthetically pleasing shops and dainty vacation spots are your things, be sure to hit Emily with the follow button, and if you’re an elegant yet chic boutique, antique shop, or cafe, definitely consider partnering with this influencer.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:858px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"858px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e28fe0d768c6d3a4655e8_Emily-Fanning.png\" alt=\"Emily Fanning\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><em>Lauren Mims</em></h3><p>Lauren Mims encompasses all things, Colorado. Lauren spends a lot of time in the outdoors of her beautiful state, where she goes on scenic hikes and hangouts out with her best friend, Coco (her adorable dog). As well as hiking trails, she shares with her followers some of her favorite #foody meals, such as cauliflower pizza or churro doughnuts that are to die for. If you’re looking to tap into a localized audience in Colorado, Lauren is your go-to-girl! She advises brands: “Do your research (on influencers) and don’t take it lightly. A huge follower count is so alluring, but could easily be inflated. Check their entire sphere – even use specific platforms for making sure an influencer’s engagement is legitimate. You should work with influencers that are on-brand and authentic or you will never see the return you’re looking for.</p><p>” At a following of 17 thousand on Instagram, Lauren hopes to continue and grow the size of her community to work with brands that resonate with her brand of travelers and site-seers. In the meantime, her <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/why-localization-is-a-key-to-build-a-global-ecommerce-brand/\" target=\"_blank\">localized personal </a>can help brands strategically understand a curated local audience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:945px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"945px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e28fe033385684dc31ddf_laurenmims.png\" alt=\"laurenmims\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>As influencers continue to connect with niche audiences and build authentic relationships with consumers, embracing influencer marketing is absolutely imperative for brands. Instead of running into pesky ads, consumers are open to influencer content that highlights a variety of brands from retail labels to household products, making the content trustworthy and organic. Travel and food brands can connect more closely with their audience by embracing influencers.</p><p>User-generated content creates a story for travel destinations and restaurant experiences giving travel and food brands the perfect channel for improving brand-customer relationships and loyalty. Influencers are trusted by their community of followers, and this helps build social proof for brands and brings awareness to tourist locations and food joints.

Social Photo Contests</strong></a></h2><p> One of the best user-generated content tools for generating more content from your followers is through contests and campaigns. Hosting a contest encouraging followers to share photos or videos of themselves using or interacting with your products can help increase brand awareness and boost engagement. Directing omnichannel campaigns helps engage customers, and the resulting content can be used for future campaigns and projects.To make a contest more effective, you need to be able to collect and permission content at scale and measure results. Using specific campaign hashtags makes it easy to collect all the UGC associated with the campaign. With <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/the-6-hottest-forms-of-content-for-ecommerce-brands-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">social media contest</a> tools, you can automatically collect tagged posts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter so you never miss any great user-generated content.

Social media is one of the primary sources for UGC, but it’s not the only way you can capture original user-generated content. If you want a tool that will streamline content sharing, try using a direct uploader. A direct uploader lets customers share content directly with your brand without needing to upload it to their social profile. There are a few different ways to use a direct uploader tool: </p><ul> \t<li>Source user-generated content online by embedding it on your site.</li> \t<li>Add the upload link to your live chat to get photos from site visitors.</li> \t<li>Create a dedicated landing page for contests or targeted campaigns to capture UGC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1216px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1216px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e299e9c4f72c8b270671b_Screen-Shot-2018-10-24-at-2.17.59-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018 10 24 at 2.17.59 PM\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>HYLETE uses a direct uploader to collect their content and then connect those with their ratings &amp; reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>Good user-generated content uploaders that let customers submit user-generated content from their mobile device, desktop, or social media profiles.

Influencer Marketing</strong></a></h2><p>High-quality user-generated content and influencer marketing go hand in hand. Influencers are constantly creating original, high-performing content for their followers.

In addition to finding the right influencers, you can manage your campaigns from start to finish and track results. &nbsp;</p><p>Focusing solely on influencer marketing may seem expensive and daunting, so coupling some influencer campaigns with other UGC from your brand’s community may be a more well-rounded and efficient marketing solution</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1279px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1279px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2994f43b6b62fc12eec6_pic1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Tarte showcases influencer content alongside UGC to create an inclusive and diverse brand experience.</figcaption></figure><p>While each of these user-generated content tools are great on their own, sourcing, collecting, and curating user-generated can seem overwhelming.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">Brands have been jumping in on relevant events for years, but it’s easier now more than ever for them to jump in on other trends that may not be completely relevant to their organization’s offering. Although it seems like an easy marketing ploy, you’ll want to make sure that your brand is fully aware of what trendjacking is and how it can help (or even potentially hurt) your brand in the current <a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/state-of-social-media-marketing-2019\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">state of social media</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Jumping in on the Trendjacking Train</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Trendjacking is a strategy used by brands in almost every industry and companies ranging from small, local business to large, international corporations. Trendjacking is the practice of jumping in on trending topics, hashtags, events, or memes. Brands and companies can use trendjacking as a means to bring a conversation to their brand or connect with their audience or target audience in a new way.</p><p id=\"\">In order to make sure you’re set up for success, learn what benefits it may bring, and some best tips on how to do it right. </p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What are the Benefits of Trendjacking?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Trendjacking, when done right, can help you improve brand image and help your marketing team improve on other goal areas as well. You have the potential to drive more eyes to your social accounts by jumping in on the conversation. If your trendjacking is done right, you can amplify the conversation around your brand and bring new followers to your accounts. However, you’ll need to ensure that you have opportunities to convert these social viewers into website traffic or even leads. Make sure that your posts and accounts have relevant links in other posts and account information that can drive traffic to specific landing pages. Using trendjacking often provides simple and easy content for your brand to publish. It allows you to join in on an existing conversation rather than creating a new conversation on your own. You won’t have to entice others to join your new conversation and can instead communicate with others already chatting.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Is Trendjacking Right for us?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Deciding whether or not trendjacking is the right decision for your brand isn’t always the easiest decision. If done right, it can help your brand stay visible in a world full of different brands. On the other hand, if trendjacking is done wrong, you can end up having to apologize for a poor post and risk isolating a portion of your current audience. You’ll want to make sure that the efforts you put into trendjacking drives value back to your brand whether that’s in the form of traffic or sales. When deciding whether or not to jump in on this strategy, you’ll need to identify if the trend is relevant to your audience. Trendjacking tends to be harder for B2B companies than it is for B2C companies who thrive off of personal and often casual relationships built with their clientele. Your marketing team will need to figure out if posting time-sensitive, trending content can fit in with your overall brand strategy, or if you should stick to more traditional campaigns.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Make Trendjacking Work for your Brand</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Stay up-to-Date on Internet Culture</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Internet culture moves at lightning speed, so if you want trendjacking to work for your brand, you’ll need to make sure that your brand is capable of <a href=\"https://www.brafton.com/content-creation/\" target=\"_blank\">producing and publishing the trending content quickly</a>. An outdated trend post is isolating to your audience. For example, if a brand came out today with a “Keep Calm and Carry On” meme post, many followers would be confused by the post due to its irrelevance. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">It’s best to only jump in on this strategy if your team is up to date on internet trends and can quickly create a campaign with the help of a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/use-cases/shoppable-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">social media management tool</a>. </p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Make Sure You Understand the Meme’s Full Context</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In order to avoid posting a potentially controversial post, make sure that you understand the full context of the meme and trend. Choosing to jump in on a trend that has political implications or has a racist background can cause a PR nightmare for your organization. Before deciding to post relevant content, do a little research on the trend’s origin.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Choose a Trend that’s Relevant to Your Brand</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Unsurprisingly, not every internet trend is going to be right for your brand. You’ll need to make sure that you only jump in on the ones that relate to your brand image. Jumping in on a trend shouldn’t seem like a long stretch. Your audience should see somewhat of a natural link between your brand and the trend’s conversation.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Give it Your Original Touch</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If your brand is jumping in on a trend, you’re likely to not be the only company in the conversation. Therefore, make sure that your trendjacking is unique and is not just a copy of what other brands or what your competitors are doing. Put your brand’s spin on it and make sure it’s tailored to your audience that you have and the audience that you’re trying to target. Perhaps try using UGC or customer content to help engage your audience even better!</p><h1 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Three Brands Trendjacking Right</strong></h1><p id=\"\">The best way to get inspiration for trendjacking is to find brands seeing success with this strategy and use them as a guideline for what you want your brand to do. Here are three brands that took trendjacking to the next level.</p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Budlight</strong></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:300px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"300px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2910ecee876cad2c7538_Screen-Shot-2019-08-09-at-2.12.25-PM-300x168.png\" alt=\"Budlight area 51 campaign image\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Image courtesy of Budlight</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Like a few other brands, Bud Light quickly hopped in on the Facebook event that suggested storming Area 51. Bud Light’s marketing team created a mock-up of cans that commemorated the event and even featured an alien silhouette upfront. Although these cans never went into production, the tweet received tens of thousands of retweets and amplified the conversation around the trend. </p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Netflix</strong></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:300px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"300px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29105c85e9b41191513d_netflix-300x84.png\" alt=\"netflib campaign tweet\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"> Image courtesy of Netflix’s twitter</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">If you were on Twitter, or even the internet, in 2018, it’s likely you remember the great debacle of iHop temporarily changing its name to iHob. This marketing ploy gave an avenue for other brands to jump in on the conversation. Netflix joined in and tweeted out jokingly that they were changing their name from Netflix to Netflib. Although Netflix has nothing to do with the food industry, it didn’t seem like a large jump for their brand to join the conversation. </p><p id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Oreo</strong></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:233px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"233px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2910a4b506385623fc39_oreotweet-233x300.png\" alt=\"oreo tweet from superbowl\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"> Image courtesy of Oreo’s Twitter</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Oreo cookie’s social media team is one that keeps a fun, casual tone on their Twitter presence. They often post relevant memes and customize them to their brand from labeling the zodiac signs as different types of Oreos to creating Game of Thrones-themed prints for the final season. Perhaps the most memorable post of there’s was a timely tweet during the SuperBowl in 2013. The power went out in the stadium, and Oreo jumped in and posted a graphic that referenced the power outage, saying that people can still dunk Oreos in the dark. This quick tweet was well-received during an event that’s already overloaded by advertisements.</p><p id=\"\">‍<em id=\"\">Anastasia Masters is a Content Marketing Associate at </em><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">G2.com</em></a><em id=\"\"> and you can follow her on Twitter at </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/anastasia_mm0\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">@anastasia_mm0</em></a><em id=\"\">.

    "content": "<p>You probably encounter social storefronts several times a day but may not know exactly what they are. A <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-social-storefront\">social storefront is a functional ecommerce store within an established social media network</a>. Having a social media presence gives brands a chance to engage with customers and to mold the perception of a product, service, or mission. The popularity of social media means there is a huge base of potential customers waiting to be tapped, and social storefronts provide a way for brands to turn casual followers into customers and drive conversions.</p><h3><strong>Go Where the Customers Are</strong></h3><p>The way consumers discover new brands and products and make purchases has shifted to social media and with a social storefront, brands can take advantage of that to drive conversions. &nbsp;One of the major benefits of shoppable content is that it provides brands the opportunity to educate shoppers while they are on the path to make a purchase. The interactive nature of social media offers opportunities for brands that traditional product advertising does not.Social content on sites like Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, etc. is powerful because it is visually compelling. These platforms drive the creation of real customer photos and videos, creating the perfect ecosystem to introduce engaging, visual content from brands. According to HubSpot data, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30239/71-More-Likely-to-Purchase-Based-on-Social-Media-Referrals-Infographic.aspx\">71% of consumers</a> are more likely to purchase based on social media referrals.</p><h3><strong>Shoppable User-Generated Content </strong></h3><p>The kind of content brands share on social media is incredibly important. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-user-generated-content\">User-generated content</a> (UGC) is any visual media created by users of an online system that is accessible via social media. When presented with user-generated content, 50% of consumers were more likely to buy a brand’s products through social channels. UGC is trusted by consumers—it provides social proof that others are purchasing the product and helps potential customers see themselves using the product or service. By making the content more personal and relatable, shoppable UGC can increase <a href=\"https://growthstackers.com/blogs/news/how-brands-are-getting-creative-with-shoppable-media\">the conversion rate by 29%</a>.</p><p>Integrating eCommerce and social media helps brands close the distance that traditional eCommerce often creates. Social media provides a space where people connect and engage with one another, and brands can take advantage of that to build relationships with their customers. User-generated content helps achieve this and drive conversions at the same time.</p><h3><strong>The Future of Shoppable Social Media</strong></h3><p>Shoppable content on social media is still relatively new but it reflects the shift in online shopping experience from a commerce-centric model to a more content-driven model. Brands are beginning to focus more on the overall <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewarnold/2018/04/04/are-we-entering-the-era-of-social-shopping/#47ed5e1f56e1\">user experience</a> of their customers, and shoppable social media is a major part of those efforts. Creating compelling visual content is only the first step. The ease of transaction and seamless shopping experience are two important factions for brands to consider as they guide customers through the funnel.</p><p>The seamless experience can be seen with Instagram’s shoppable photos—customers can click on the post and see more about the product without navigating to another site. It offers an online version of “window shopping”—consumers can view the product and the price quickly and easily.</p><p>Social commerce is still developing, and there are naturally some bumps in the road. Some adopters feel that there are too many steps between the consumer seeing a post and actually converting. However, the consumers that do click on the post and explore the e-commerce site are <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/social-commerce-is-here-but-is-it-ready-for-the-mainstream-consumer/\">much more likely to purchase. </a> The technology is still developing and will likely improve in the future, but brands that use social storefronts and shoppable content strategically will benefit from the ability to reach a wider audience of customers via social media.</p><p>Want to learn more about how you can capitalize on the marketing power of user-generated content? <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/request-demo\">Contact us</a> today for a demo of the Pixlee platform!</p>",

This marketing strategy allows brands to work with influencers to create content aligned with the brand’s voice and message.</p><p id=\"\">While the influencer will still be present in the ad, the brand has an opportunity to optimize content. This could include things like editing copy or adding call-to-action buttons or a discount code.</p><p id=\"\">This is different from brand-owned content in that the ads run through the influencer’s account and show up under their handle. Brand-owned content can be limited in reach, often targeting the same audience.</p><p id=\"\">While allow-listing is possible on other platforms, Facebook and Instagram have built-in tools to provide the best experience.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why You Should Use Allow-listing?</h2><p id=\"\">Marketing is all about promoting <em id=\"\">and </em>selling products or services.

Advertisers can then add the influencer as a Business Partner on their Business Manager, and once they accept, the allow-listing campaign can begin. Ads can be created and posted from Facebook Ads Manager, where the influencer's accounts will be available. It's important to note that allow-listing will only work if an influencer has a Facebook Business Manager account with linked Facebook and Instagram accounts. Without this, you won't be able to run ads through their account.</p><h3 id=\"\">Benefits of Allow-listing</h3><p id=\"\">Increased reach is nothing without conversion.

Your business will benefit from: </p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Running Dark Posts</li></ul><p id=\"\">One significant benefit of allow-listing is dark posts. These are ads created by a brand that run through an influencer’s account without cluttering up influencer feeds, stories, or timelines. While the ads show up under the influencer’s handle, they’re only visible to a targeted audience, allowing a brand to narrow down each piece of content’s viewers and build a lookalike audience through ads manager.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Better Audience Targeting</li></ul><p id=\"\">The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. It’s also the definition of stale marketing campaigns.</p><p id=\"\">With allow-listing, brands can reach new and larger audiences. This provides an opportunity to test ads out on specific audiences through targeted posts.</p><p id=\"\">Testing different call-to-actions, copy, or content types on different audiences will indicate what’s working and what isn’t.

Allow-listing may also not always be the answer to your influencer partnership. The best way to get creative value from influencers is by having them authenticate with a creator platform like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/pixlee-for-creators-faq\" id=\"\">Pixlee for Creators</a>; then, any content they post about your brand can immediately be ingested into your platform to use elsewhere. Because the influencers you work with have already taken the initiative to sign up and will be producing their own content that aligns with the focused audience they’ve built on social media, this approach may provide higher ROI and customer loyalty in the long run.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1294px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1294px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e2ad0f52c2e1c33009cd8_image1-copy-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Kimpton re-shares influencer content on its social media profiles, combining company messaging with authentic consumer experiences.</p><h2 id=\"\">Finding the Right Influencer </h2><p id=\"\">Both influencer allow-listing and using a creator platform to start a general campaign are powerful marketing tools, but only when you have the right influencer.</p><p id=\"\">Don’t fret over the number of followers an account has.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">When online shoppers visit a product page, one of the first things they’ll do is read its reviews. Checking a product's reviews is common today, especially for consumers who haven’t purchased or used the product before. Since they can't physically check the quality of the product, shoppers tend to base their purchasing decisions off of online reviews.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://findstack.com/online-review-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">89%</a> of customers make an effort to read product reviews before making a purchase. Customer reviews are more reliable than product information provided by the brand itself, as shoppers typically share their genuine opinions and experiences with the product.</p><p id=\"\">However, not everyone wants to leave a review when they buy a&nbsp; product. That's quite an issue if you're just establishing your business. If no one leaves a review about your brand/product, you'll attract fewer customers, and that's not good for business.</p><p id=\"\">While encouraging people to leave a review via incentives like discounts or free products can work, you may want to opt for a more long-term strategy. This is why you need <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/features-and-use-cases/review-syndication-for-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">review syndication</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">What is Review Syndication?</h2><p id=\"\">Review syndication is the process of republishing reviews from a brand or other direct-to-consumer (DTC) website on other retailer websites where customers can purchase the same product. When a brand or retail produces a new product and wants to get it into the hands of potential customers, they have to find ways to make that happen. Review syndication allows customer feedback to circulate between brand and retailer websites, making sure it’s easily visible to all online shoppers.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1432px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1432px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/631b99e0d740e08661848133_WN8JR7IyXndVb3VRVY9EKfDYizhCgrTwhXj8z5DR4rvaYpA6qUZjnOKxKHt91LRMtEqsWcP3aKo7-20qOxY66UY9T_4IC6RINVfmS6jIp3b5dJAn2EFdAygYgBCW4n7bnWDZpDmarYD_EEV_agQe9Qj5WelZ5xv84lULiot2HH9PZbg2b-KkSQEzbQ.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">‍<a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/features-and-use-cases/review-syndication-for-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Review syndication for retailers</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> </strong>allows retailers to collect and display product reviews initially left on brand websites. For example, health and nutrition <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/gnc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">retailer GNC</a> sells products from hundreds of unique brands like KAGED. With Pixlee TurnTo, reviews from KAGED’s website are syndicated to also be visible on GNC’s product pages.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/features-and-use-cases/review-syndication-for-brands\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Review syndication for brands</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> </strong>describes the same process from a brand’s perspective; brands can seed reviews posted at their own websites onto retailer sites to maximize the reach of each review. <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/natures-bakery-llc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Nature’s Bakery</a> uses Pixlee TurnTo to publish reviews on Walmart.com, as Walmart is an important retailer to the brand’s overall success.</p><p id=\"\">Essentially, your brand's name will appear alongside your review on every site you've syndicated your content. So that when readers search for information about a particular product, they're more likely to find your review easily if it's posted on multiple sites rather than just your own. This can help retailers and brands alike reach a broader audience while simultaneously driving conversion and instilling purchase confidence in shoppers.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">What are the Benefits of Review Syndication for Retailers and Brands?</h2><p id=\"\">The benefits of review syndication include increased sales, traffic to your product pages, and brand recognition. Showcasing authentic reviews across a variety of third-party websites and retailers ensures that shoppers will be able to access that social proof, no matter which site they’re browsing on.</p><p id=\"\">Keep in mind that consumers are often hesitant to purchase a product they haven't tried before. They may be drawn in by an advertisement but be hesitant to click \"buy\" without seeing reviews from other customers who have tried it. Review syndication gives those potential customers another way to learn more about the product. </p><p id=\"\">Additionally, syndicated reviews can be incredibly useful when it comes to newly-listed products on a retailer’s website. Pixlee TurnTo’s proprietary data shows that the first five reviews on a product page yield the highest incremental sales lift, 9.5% on average. This means that those first reviews are the most important, reviews that can be captured instantly with syndication.</p><p id=\"\">In a survey of online shoppers, <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">93%</a> of respondents said reviews influence their purchasing decisions. That's why adding product reviews are important for businesses as they help attract more audiences. Customer testimonials are valuable across marketing strategies, like Instagram and <a href=\"http://pixlee.com/blog/tiktok-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">TikTok marketing</a>, where brands can produce review video content on these platforms.</p><p id=\"\">Review syndication can also positively impact SEO for brands and retailers. Customers tend to use product-specific, or “long-tail,” keywords in their reviews. When these reviews are featured on a brand or retailer website, other shoppers searching similar key phrases will be more likely to end up on your product page.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, correctly-syndicated reviews won’t be flagged by Google as duplicate content, which is positive for SEO. Now, let’s dive into how you can get started with syndication, the right way.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Start Review Syndication</h2><p id=\"\">First, determine which retailer websites sell your brand’s products.Once you've found a few sites, look at their review guidelines. Some sites may have specific requirements, like the number of words your review must have or if you must include photos.</p><p id=\"\">Many review syndication services claim to have “open” networks, yet charge participating brands and retailers hefty fees or use data from competing platform vendors. With Pixlee TurnTo, you can syndicate reviews from any brand participating, without any gating from the brand’s platform providers, paving the way for more review coverage and a secure, efficient partnership.</p><p id=\"\">Therefore, the best way to start syndicating reviews is by using a platform like Pixlee TurnTo — over 1,000 brands are already a part of this network.

    "content": "<p>Modern brands need to design their marketing strategies with the customer at the center. From small direct-to-consumer brands to globally renowned luxury brands, user-generated content (UGC) can help brands connect better to consumers. In fact, UGC is one of the most scalable, cost-effective ways to create a relatable experience for customers. But why? Delving into the psychology behind UGC, these five factors offer clues into the success behind UGC.</p><h2><strong>1. Hyper-Connectivity and Bombardment of Messages</strong></h2><p>UGC works because it is relatable. Consumers interact with that type of content more because it feels authentic, compared to the myriad brand marketing messages that feel inauthentic. With social media, consumers are exposed to far more images and messages than ever before. With this, consumers have become increasingly better at sussing out content that overtly pushes a sale or worse, feels tone-deaf. To stop the social feed scroll, brands need to employ eye-catching tactics. UGC does precisely that. Many brands are already successfully employing this concept in their feed. Brands like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/resources-page?cs=kirkland-s-uses-pixlee-to-keep-content-fresh-community-engaged-during-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">Kirkland's</a> use UGC to show how their pieces actually look in people's houses. This engages the audience well beyond a stock photo while creating a relatable and cohesive experience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:645px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"645px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/628e29853ede1d500e531fe8_Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-4.12.22-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 06 08 at 4.12.22 PM\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>2. Ego-Defensiveness and Belonging</strong></h2><p>The widely-accepted functional theory of attitudes in psychology includes four distinct personality functions that motivate consumer behavior, one being ego-defensiveness. People use ego-defensive motivation to protect themselves from internal insecurities and external threats. A consumer psychology <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237201239_Exploring_Consumer_Motivations_for_Creating_User-Generated_Content\" target=\"_blank\">research study</a> found empirical evidence that people post UGC because it makes them feel important, needed, and increases their self-esteem. Social connection is closely related to ego-defensiveness as well; by posting content online, people identify with others who are also consuming the same products. It makes you feel like part of a community, which is a strong motivator to continue posting. Social media has made it possible to remain in touch with hundreds of friends easily. We not only want to connect with them, but we also want to impress them and be like them. What better way to do this by posting content that they are posting too? </p><h2><strong>3. Influence from Peers </strong></h2><p>There’s no denying the fact that people care what others think when making a decision. The <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/is-social-proof-marketing-the-next-big-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">psychology of social proof</a> plays its part in shaping people’s opinions, especially regarding something that’s new for them, and this is one of the reasons why UGC becomes so effective. No matter how “independent” and “self-sufficient” someone may consider themselves to be, the reality is that humans are largely influenced by the experiences of others. If someone posts about their positive experience with a new sushi delivery service while you were already searching for one, you would actually be thankful to them for guiding your way. Similarly, a large number of shares of a fast-food chain review will be indicative of the fact that it resonated with other consumers right off the bat. So, you would be inclined to try it out. These are examples of social proof that help to instigate the consumers’ trust and make the brand or business more credible and worthy of being tried. </p><h2><strong>4. Authenticity</strong></h2><p>Another edge that UGC has over traditional brand content is that it reflects authenticity – the genuine emotions of the common individual enjoying a product or service are far more relatable than a stock photo or branded shoot. 75% of people surveyed indicated that UGC feels <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/9-things-we-learned-from-the-2018-user-generated-content-ugc-report/513245/\" target=\"_blank\">more authentic</a>, and 48% of marketers also consider it to be a better option from the marketing perspective. Essentially, it’s all about humanizing a brand’s message and building a relationship with the consumers, rather than merely making sales. When real people share stories of their experiences with a brand, both good and bad, others appreciate their transparency. This genuine experience translates to a good opinion of the brand.</p><h2><strong>5. A Sense of Approval </strong></h2><p>Validation is a natural thing for people to seek from others. We rely on social cues and direct feedback to validate our feelings and perceptions of the world around us. And this exact need aligns with UGC.</p><p>If a customer is noticed by their favorite brand for sharing an unboxing video, they're receiving validation for that engagement. That feedback loop gets consumers motivated to share more content with the brand, which causes them to feel good and simultaneously results in word-of-mouth marketing for the brand.</p><p>User-generated content is not merely a marketing strategy employed by brands to make sales. By marketing content created by the users, for the users, a brand inevitably accrues a community of loyal consumers. While doing this can immensely improve a brand’s position in the market and help them achieve a better reputation while making sales, the authenticity and personal connection between the brand and consumer developed in the process is perhaps the most important effect to recognize. UGC goes beyond simpler marketing strategies; it is a revolutionary avenue to form relationships.</p><p>‍<em>Nouman provides ghostwriting and copywriting services.

    "content": "<p>Influencer marketing has emerged as a powerful force for businesses across many industries, and the relationships that brands can build with influencers can create irreplaceable value when executed well. Influencers have the power to affect the buying habits of their followers by uploading original—sometimes sponsored—content to social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook or LinkedIn.</p><p>Retailers, however, may be forgiven for not immediately seeing meaningful value in hiring influencers, especially since driving traffic to your stores and increasing in-store purchases with influencers is not as easily linked to sales revenue, for example, as it is to visual merchandising. However, ecommerce and digital shoppers are a definite fit for influencers, whose social media posts on products and brands are read and acted upon by their followers. Their audience is online, and simply one click away from shopping an ecommerce site. Converting that digital interest into in-person traffic will be critical in 2021 as in-person shopping reemerges for consumers.</p><h2><strong>Converting Digital to In-Person</strong></h2><p>Success with influencers in driving retail sales depends largely on first partnering with the right type of influencer for your brand. Then, leveraging that authentic relationship to drive traffic to your stores such as visual merchandising, customer service and branded environments can take over to close the sale.Here are some basic tips retailers need to consider when seeking the right fit with the right influencer to build a successful program that gets more people into stores and boosts sales. </p><h2><strong>Non-celebrity Influencers are Underrated</strong></h2><p>Not only are celebrities hugely expensive, they are sometimes not the right marketing tactic. 30% of <a href=\"https://shanebarker.com/blog/influencer-marketing-celebrity-endorsements/\" target=\"_blank\">surveyed</a> consumers are more likely to purchase a product in-store endorsed by a non-celebrity blogger than by a celebrity. Only 3% of consumers would consider buying a product in-store if it was endorsed by a celebrity. As the survey results show, most retail consumers respond much more to influencers who are simply individuals, like them. If the influencer is a prominent fan of your retail brand, then chances are, their community of followers (no matter how many) could be fans too. Listen to the feedback the influencer provides about your brand, because that is how their review will resonate authentically with their followers. The influencer’s followers will know right away that an endorsement is an authentic one by the influencer, and not ‘manufactured’ for their consumption.</p><p>At the end of the day, you want to make sure the influencer is a good fit by understanding how they feel about your retail brand. The influencer has to genuinely resonate with your retail brand, and only then will it work. Trying to force a good review of your brand’s in-store experience is not going to convince anyone. </p><h2><strong>Leverage Mobile Marketing for In-store Events</strong></h2><p>Successfully driving in-store purchases is the holy grail of influencer marketing for retail, and mobile marketing techniques are a key ingredient for success. Make sure your influencer campaigns are linked to reaching consumers on their mobile devices before making a purchase, or while they are in-store shopping. Consumers often read influencer online reviews about products and brand endorsements while they shop in-store. &nbsp;Ads on popular apps like Facebook and WhatsApp Messenger are worth investing in, as more than 1.5 billion people use these apps and are great tools for influencers to share their content about your retail brand, especially during shopping hours.</p><p>Another mobile marketing tool to tie-in to the influencer campaign is a quick store locator. This will help an influencer’s followers to find the nearest location to buy your retail products and services. Create in-store events, like product launch parties, or live experiences with the influencer—like classes or product demonstrations that followers will benefit from. Create a buzz about the event on social media, before, during and after.</p><p>Retailers are also blurring the lines between virtual influencer content online and in-store experiences—by creating visual merchandising that reflects the social media experience. With more shoppers using phones in-store during shopping, it makes sense to translate that visually in window displays and other point-of-sale merchandising. Linking influencer campaigns on social media with in-store displays, are a great way for retailers to drive traffic to their stores and engage shoppers.</p><p>The retailer, Nordstrom, set up a 3D Instagram <a href=\"https://www.luxurydaily.com/nordstrom-goes-big-with-rooftop-instagram-installation-to-promote-sale/\" target=\"_blank\">installation on a store roof</a> showing a leopard-print dress as part of a large-scale Instagram post. And Victoria’s Secret created a campaign asking shoppers to <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/ex/mobilecommercedaily/victorias-secret-unclasps-new-marketing-method-with-in-store-selfie-activations\" target=\"_blank\">take a selfie</a> in front of a display and show it to sales personnel for a free gift. </p><h2><strong>Provide Generous Access </strong></h2><p>Influencer marketing for retail works best when it is part of a retail marketing strategy that is linked to a product or service promotion, limited time or special offer. One of the best influencer strategies for retailers stems from influencer-generated reviews of key products or services through a blog post, Tweet, Instagram post, or other user-generated content. Surprisingly, many retailers who work with influencers only consider providing access to brand-related products (usually for free) as an after-thought. Authentic reviews of a product or service work to drive traffic to your stores, and it is important to allow influencers to experience what you’re offering to customers, so they can write reviews without the slightest bit of coercion.</p><h2><strong>Create A Buzz With Micro-influencers</strong></h2><p>If a retailer is new to working with influencers, one of the best ways to begin, in terms of cost-effectiveness and easily measurable ROI, is to focus on promoting and amplifying a unique in-store experience. If you want to move the needle on footfall, it would be best if you link an influencer’s review to a specific event. Perhaps you have a product launch, special event or limited-time offer in a specific outlet or area. If your target audience for an in-store event is living within a specific geographic area, then micro-influencers are ideal for promoting a campaign like this.</p><p>Micro-influencers usually have a reach of between 1,000 and 10,000 followers, and therefore target a much moreniche audience. They are also less expensive to work with, which makes them ideal for short campaigns, where a retailer can see the return in a short period of time.</p><p>Micro-influencers can offer niche community access, based on shared interests or locales —and that is exactly the audience you want to reach to promote your in-store shopping event. Most importantly, micro-influencers are seen as extremely relatable, and their followers tend to be highly engaged. If a micro-influencer endorses a retailer, it is immediately seen as a genuine recommendation by their followers from someone who is a lot like them. </p><h1><strong>Show How Products Look And Feel On Real People</strong></h1><p>Micro-influencers are closer to their followers than celebrities are, in terms of personal appearance and lifestyle, so they are ideal for demonstrating how your products look and feel on real people. Followers can easily see themselves purchasing and enjoying products that their favorite micro-influencers recommend, so leveraging this can help with your marketing campaigns.. For example, choose one or several relevant micro-influencers who have followings that are interested in your type of products or services, and then get them involved in creating a new line of products. The aim is to entice an influencer’s followers to become customers but also to enhance the relationship between the influencer and your retail brand. Being a part of a special line of products may compel an influencer to promote a brand more naturally, since they are a part of the creation of the products or services. In turn, this will also encourage their followers to post their own products, creating a vast amount of user generated content for the brand to use and become more community driven. Ultimately, consider that working with influencers is a lot like building a relationship, and you need to have a two-way conversation with an influencer, just as you would with any stakeholder in your retail brand. It’s a partnership with a mission to grow interest in your brand’s in-store experiences. </p><p>‍<em>Ray Ko is the Senior Ecommerce Manager at </em><a href=\"https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ShopPOPDisplays</em></a><em>.

    "content": "<p id=\"\">People are constantly sharing their opinions about brands, whether that means promoting them directly to friends and family, leaving a review on the brand’s website, or taking their feedback to social media. In recent years, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become popular destinations to discover new products. This trend has given rise to <a href=\"http://pixlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">user-generated content</a> (UGC): media featuring a brand or product created (and often shared on social channels) by everyday people instead of the brand itself.</p><p id=\"\">As a marketer, you likely know the power of UGC in persuading potential buyers and improving brand awareness. However, like many marketers at direct-to-consumer brands, you may be hesitant to fully embrace UGC as a form of ecommerce photography for your marketing channels, either because it seems difficult to collect or its quality isn’t up to your brand standards.</p><p id=\"\">Luckily, there are ways around these roadblocks, and relying on UGC as a main content source for your ecommerce photography may end up being a more efficient, cost-effective, and persuasive strategy. Let’s dive into why this is and how your brand can start collecting more high-quality UGC..</p><h1 id=\"\">Why Ecommerce Brands Need UGC&nbsp;</h1><p id=\"\">UGC is influential for many reasons. <a href=\"https://merkleyandpartners.wordpress.com/2016/05/20/how-to-connect-with-consumers-via-user-generated-content-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">93% of consumers</a> agree that UGC can aid purchasing decisions. Conversion rates<a href=\"https://everyonesocial.com/blog/user-generated-content-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> go up by 10%</a> when UGC is used at some point in the purchasing process. Gathering community-driven content from your audience also makes <a href=\"https://www.connection.com/content/office-technology/working-in-a-remote-world\" target=\"_blank\">remote marketing</a> cost-effective and easier to maintain.</p><p id=\"\">In analyzing the above statistics, we can confidently say that UGC doesn’t just get consumers more excited about making a purchase, it often convinces them to do so. Let’s examine some of the main reasons why UGC positively impacts purchase confidence.</p><h2 id=\"\">UGC Contextualizes Your Product</h2><p id=\"\">Shoppers want to see products in action when they head to your ecommerce site, whether it’s yoga apparel on a real person out in the world or ingredients from a food brand used to create a delicious plate. In any industry, contextualizing your product through UGC allows prospective buyers to imagine themselves owning your product and using it in their day-to-day lives.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63b5e9a0780a26ebcc97cd55_image3%20(9).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Contextualizing a product can take on many forms. Jewelry brand Lagos shares UGC from real customers in an on-site, shoppable UGC gallery to show site visitors how their pieces can be styled to complement different looks, complexions, additional jewelry, and more.</p><h2 id=\"\">UGC Promotes Trust in Your Brand</h2><p id=\"\">In an age where any brand can create an ad on social media or run a commercial on a streaming service, people tend to trust their peers over brands themselves. In fact, <a href=\"https://ecommercefastlane.com/podcast/episode-41/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">96% of consumers</a> believe traditional advertising is done to intentionally mislead them.</p><p id=\"\">When a consumer can easily access honest feedback and media from people like them on your ecommerce website, they’re more likely to trust your product’s quality and your brand in general. Even when it comes to <a href=\"https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/brand-ambassador-job-description\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand ambassadors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/influencer-marketing\" id=\"\">influencer marketing</a>, social users trust these individuals to make good recommendations for brands they truly trust and enjoy.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1600px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63b5e9a8a257ed6fa12fd543_image1%20(10).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/farrow-ball\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Farrow &amp; Ball</a> is one of many ecommerce brands to not only showcase a high volume of reviews from real buyers, but also publish visual UGC on product pages for site visitors to peruse. The brand uses Pixlee TurnTo to build vibrant, eye-catching displays unique to individual products and ultimately drive conversion while increasing time spent on-site.</p><p id=\"\">Allowing a real person to create the content for you and give an authentic account of their brand or product experience comes across as a lot more genuine than content created by the marketing department. This helps consumers trust you and continue in the marketing funnel.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">UGC Shows Your Brand Cares</h2><p id=\"\">In the same vein as brand awareness and trust, interacting with your customers’ UGC shows them that your brand truly values them as a part of your online community. By highlighting customer content, you’re ensuring that <a href=\"https://www.lytics.com/blog/how-to-avoid-alienating-potential-audiences-with-your-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">shoppers know you actually listen to</a> and make improvements related to their feedback. You’re also encouraging them to continue sharing UGC around your products.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/63b5e9bf780a2612b5980108_image2%20(10).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies/radio-flyer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Radio Flyer</a> drove a 7x increase in conversion and boosted time spent on-site 85% by publishing 117 UGC displays across the brand’s ecommerce website. Collected through Pixlee TurnTo, this UGC conveys the brand’s dedication to supporting its community and celebrating customers.</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“Pixlee TurnTo has been a great solution for our team to help cut down the time and resources used, and to help spread this awesome user-generated content we receive from our families across multiple channels, and not just social media.” — Mindy Schanzle, Marketing Communications Lead, Radio Flyer</em></blockquote><p id=\"\">All of these points underline UGC’s benefits as ecommerce photography for your brand. It’s important to keep in mind that you don’t have to choose between professional photography and customer media; <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/blog/how-branded-content-works-with-ugc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">branded content and UGC</a> often provide the most context and purchase confidence when used together as part of your content strategy.</p><h1 id=\"\">A Quick Guide to Collecting UGC&nbsp;</h1><p id=\"\">Any business in any industry can take advantage of UGC. And they should, considering the benefits listed above. But one of the biggest hurdles holding companies back is needing to learn how to efficiently collect high-quality UGC from their customers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">First and foremost, you need a real strategy. Digitally document or write down the following to form a strategy for collecting UGC:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Why do you want to collect UGC?</li><li id=\"\">What will you use it for?&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Where do you want to use it?</li><li id=\"\">What are your ideas for where to collect it?</li><li id=\"\">How will you convince users to create and submit it?</li><li id=\"\">How will you ensure your collection and use of UGC maintains brand safety?</li></ul><p id=\"\">After you have thought about these points above, you can begin exploring the UGC about your products that’s likely already out there on social media. While you can manually search through hashtags, mentions, and photo tags on your brand account, the most efficient way to collect, curate, and publish UGC across your marketing channels is to invest in a <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/social-ugc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social UGC platform</a> like Pixlee TurnTo’s.</p><p id=\"\">With Pixlee TurnTo, brands of various sizes can customize their UGC strategies to meet their goals while reducing the time and effort required on your team’s end. Diverse social content (both videos and static images) from a variety of channels like TikTok and Instagram are automatically collected according to your brand’s needs, with low-quality or unrelated content filtered out into spam. From there, your team can approve and automatically get permission to publish the best pieces of UGC you’ve collected.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1999px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1999px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9311fa6f6a0447cbb81040/638e8c6d3554bf6578fd9bbb_image7%20(2).webp\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">When it comes to your ecommerce website, get creative about how to showcase your community’s content. With Pixlee TurnTo, UGC can be featured on product pages, in shoppable inspiration galleries, in community-focused carousel displays, in blog posts, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Reduce manual search efforts and in-house content creation costs when you rely on UGC as ecommerce photography. Learn about how top brands like <a href=\"https://www.pixlee.com/case-studies\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Alo Yoga and Nixon already champion on-site UGC here</a>.
